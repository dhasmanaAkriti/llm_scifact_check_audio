**Doctor Phillips:** Good afternoon, Mrs. Lee. I understand you're concerned about your husband's recent melanoma treatment with PD-1 blockade therapy.

**Mrs. Lee:** Yes, Doctor. I've read that even if patients initially respond well, there's a chance their melanoma can progress again. Is that true?

**Doctor Phillips:** That's correct. Approximately 25% of patients who show an objective response to PD-1 blockade may experience progression of their melanoma. It's an important factor to consider.

**Mrs. Lee:** So, what does that mean for us? I mean, is there a risk that we're just delaying the inevitable?

**Doctor Phillips:** I understand your concern. While there's a risk of progression, the goal is to extend the period of response and improve quality of life. Each patient's journey is unique, and ongoing monitoring is crucial. We aim to catch any signs of progression early.

**Mrs. Lee:** What should we look out for, then?

**Doctor Phillips:** Regular follow-ups and scans will help us keep an eye on things. Symptoms like new skin lesions, changes in existing moles, or any unusual symptoms should be reported immediately. We're working as a team to ensure your husband receives the best care.

**Mrs. Lee:** That’s reassuring, but what if the melanoma progresses? What are our options then?

**Doctor Phillips:** If progression occurs, we have alternative therapies and clinical trials that might be suitable. The field is advancing rapidly, and new treatments are constantly being developed. Staying informed and being proactive are key.

**Mrs. Lee:** Thank you, Doctor. I feel more empowered knowing we have a plan and options.

**Doctor Phillips:** You're very welcome, Mrs. Lee. Remember, we're here to support you every step of the way. Don't hesitate to reach out with any further questions or concerns.
