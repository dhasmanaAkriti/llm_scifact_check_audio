 Scientific claim: All six cathelicidins are located on chromosome two. 
 Participant Dynamics: Practitioner vs. Decision-Maker 
 Contextual Arena: The Exploratory Arena (goal: to brainstorm and understand) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Expose a Flaw or Truth (validate or weaken the claim) 
``` 
Practitioner: So, the claim is that all six cathelicidins are located on chromosome two. This new policy mandates us to validate such genetic assertions before we proceed with research funding.

Decision-Maker: Right, and that's why we're here. We need to determine if this claim holds up under scrutiny.

Practitioner: Exactly. Now, traditionally, cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides, and if they are all on chromosome two, it simplifies our genetic mapping significantly. But is it really that straightforward?

Decision-Maker: Well, the law pushes for thorough validation. What evidence do we have so far?

Practitioner: Preliminary data from recent sequencing projects suggest variability. While some cathelicidins are indeed on chromosome two, there are indications of others on different chromosomes in some datasets.

Decision-Maker: That sounds concerning. What could be causing this discrepancy?

Practitioner: It might be genetic polymorphism or simply variations in sequencing techniques. We need more comprehensive analysis across various populations.

Decision-Maker: So, you're saying we can't accept the claim at face value just yet?

Practitioner: Precisely. The external mandate is a good push for us to dig deeper. We need corroborative studies to confirm the localization of all six cathelicidins.

Decision-Maker: If we can't validate this claim, what does that mean for our funding and research trajectory?

Practitioner: It means we need to pivot. Focus our efforts on ensuring our genetic data is robust. Perhaps collaborate with other institutions to pool resources and data.

Decision-Maker: Understood. It seems we're in for a bit more exploration before we can proceed confidently. Let's allocate a team to start validating these findings and keep the board updated.

Practitioner: I'll get right on it. Ensuring accuracy will ultimately benefit our research and uphold the integrity of our scientific endeavors.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's make that our priority.
