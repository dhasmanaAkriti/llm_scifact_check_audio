Advocate: So, Dr. Lewis, I've been exploring the recent findings on the N-formyl group and its impact on M3 molecules. It seems this could revolutionize our approach to molecular binding.

Skeptic: Ah, yes, I've heard about this claim. But isn't it a bit speculative? Suppressing strong binding to the second position of the groove sounds promising, but where's the concrete evidence?

Advocate: Well, the preliminary data are compelling. The N-formyl group appears to selectively inhibit binding without affecting other critical interactions. This could open up new pathways in drug design.

Skeptic: Preliminary data, you say. But how can we be sure that the results aren't just anomalies? We need robust, repeatable experiments to make any strategic decisions.

Advocate: Absolutely, and that's why I'm suggesting a collaborative study. If we can align our resources, we could conduct a comprehensive series of experiments to validate these results.

Skeptic: I see the potential, but I'm cautious. We need to consider the costs and the risks involved. If this doesn't pan out, we need a fallback.

Advocate: Agreed, which is why I'd propose a phased approach. We start with small-scale studies, analyze the data, and adjust our strategy as needed. The opportunity here is too great to pass up.

Skeptic: A phased approach could work. But let's ensure transparency at every stage. We need to be ready to pivot if the data leads us in a different direction.

Advocate: Absolutely, transparency is key. If we find that the N-formyl group doesn't suppress binding as expected, we'll need to explore other modifications. But the potential payoff justifies the exploration.

Skeptic: Very well, I'm open to further discussions. Let's draft a proposal and see how we can align our goals with tangible outcomes.

Advocate: Great, I'll set up a meeting with the team to outline the next steps. Together, we might just unlock a new frontier in molecular science.
