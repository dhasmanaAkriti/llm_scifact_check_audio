Dr. Lewis: Alright, team, we've got a new directive from the board. They're pushing us to explore the monoclonal antibody targeting of N-cadherin. Apparently, there's a claim that it inhibits growth. 

Dr. Patel: Yes, that's been circulating in recent journals. It's intriguing, but hardly conclusive.

Dr. Lewis: Indeed. But with the new policy, we need to decide if we'll allocate resources to investigate further. What are your initial thoughts?

Dr. Patel: Well, monoclonal antibodies are a promising avenue, but targeting N-cadherin specifically is complex. It's a cell adhesion molecule, so inhibiting it could affect normal cellular processes.

Dr. Lewis: True, but the potential benefits in controlling tumor growth could be significant. We need to weigh the risks and rewards.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. However, preliminary data is scant. The studies I've seen show mixed results, and there's a risk of adverse effects on non-target tissues.

Dr. Lewis: That's a valid point. But the directive is clear. They want us to at least consider a pilot study. 

Dr. Patel: If we're moving forward, we'll need a robust framework. Perhaps a small-scale study with a diverse cohort to assess both efficacy and safety. 

Dr. Lewis: That sounds reasonable. We should also collaborate with immunologists to understand the broader implications. 

Dr. Patel: Yes, cross-disciplinary input will be crucial. We can't afford to overlook any potential complications.

Dr. Lewis: Alright, let's draft a proposal. We'll present a balanced view of the potential and pitfalls. If we decide to proceed, it must be with eyes wide open.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. I'll start gathering the latest research and coordinate with the immunology team.

Dr. Lewis: Excellent. Let's reconvene next week with our findings. We have a lot of ground to cover. 

Dr. Patel: Agreed. It's an ambitious endeavor, but with the right approach, it could yield meaningful insights.

Dr. Lewis: Precisely. Let's get to it.
