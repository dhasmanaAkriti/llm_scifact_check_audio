Practitioner: So, Dr. Reynolds, there's this emerging data claiming that one in five surgical randomized controlled trials are discontinued early. 

Decision-Maker: That's quite alarming. What could be prompting these discontinuations?

Practitioner: Well, it seems many trials face recruitment challenges, unforeseen adverse events, or even funding issues. But here's the opportunity—understanding these factors could help us improve our trial designs and outcomes.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. If we could minimize these disruptions, the potential for advancing surgical procedures would be significant.

Practitioner: Precisely. If we delve deeper, we might identify specific procedural or logistical tweaks to enhance trial success rates.

Decision-Maker: So, what are you proposing? A dedicated task force to analyze past trials?

Practitioner: That could work. Or perhaps a symposium inviting diverse stakeholders—researchers, funders, and trial coordinators—to brainstorm solutions.

Decision-Maker: That sounds feasible. But how would you ensure this isn't just another discussion with no actionable outcomes?

Practitioner: By setting clear objectives. For instance, developing a set of best practices or a checklist for trial initiation. This way, we empower teams to foresee and mitigate common pitfalls.

Decision-Maker: I see. Such a framework could indeed transform our approach to surgical trials. But what about the financial aspect?

Practitioner: We could pitch this initiative as an investment in future cost-efficiency. By reducing trial discontinuations, we save resources that would otherwise be wasted.

Decision-Maker: You've given me a lot to think about. Let’s plan a preliminary meeting to gauge interest and scope out potential collaborators.

Practitioner: Excellent. I'll draft a proposal outlining the key points we've discussed and circulate it by next week.

Decision-Maker: Perfect. Let’s aim to turn this challenge into an opportunity for growth.

Practitioner: Agreed. Together, we can make a substantial impact on surgical research.
