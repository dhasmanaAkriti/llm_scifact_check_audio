Dr. Harris: So, Dr. Nguyen, I understand your concern, but our recent data shows that hematopoietic stem cell purification is achieving purity rates above 90%. That's groundbreaking, isn't it?

Dr. Nguyen: I'm not dismissing your data, Dr. Harris, but there's a point of confusion. The initial reports indicated a purity plateau at around 85%. How did we suddenly leap over that threshold?

Dr. Harris: Great question. We refined the isolation techniques—specifically, the magnetic separation process. It significantly reduced impurities.

Dr. Nguyen: Magnetic separation? But wasn't there an issue with sample integrity using that method?

Dr. Harris: Initially, yes. However, we've optimized the process to maintain cell viability. It's all in the latest report. 

Dr. Nguyen: I see. But there's another matter. If it truly reaches above 90%, does that mean we're ready to proceed with the clinical trial?

Dr. Harris: That's what we're here to decide, isn't it? The results certainly suggest it's feasible.

Dr. Nguyen: Feasible, perhaps, but is it wise? We need to ensure these results are replicable under varied conditions before committing to human trials.

Dr. Harris: Of course. Caution is necessary. But delaying the trials means potentially postponing life-saving treatments for patients.

Dr. Nguyen: True, and that weighs heavily on my mind. Yet, if we rush and encounter unforeseen issues, it could set us back even further.

Dr. Harris: Agreed. What if we conduct a smaller preliminary study first? Something that tests the waters before a full-scale trial?

Dr. Nguyen: That seems like a reasonable compromise. It gives us a buffer while we ensure all aspects are accounted for.

Dr. Harris: Excellent. Let's draft a proposal for the preliminary study. We'll need to present it to the board by next month.

Dr. Nguyen: Agreed. Let's make sure every step is meticulously planned. We owe that to our patients.
