**Dr. Lin:** So, Professor Mitchell, we need to talk about this new mandate pushing for CD28 augmentation in T-cell therapies. They claim it boosts immune responses, but I have my reservations.

**Professor Mitchell:** Ah, the new policy. I saw that. They argue it's a breakthrough, but you're skeptical, I gather?

**Dr. Lin:** Indeed. The claim that "CD28 initiates tonic signaling in conventional T cells, causing an exhaustion phenotype and limited efficiency" is concerning. I'm worried we're overlooking potential downsides.

**Professor Mitchell:** Interesting. You're suggesting that by enhancing CD28, we might inadvertently drive T cells to a state of exhaustion rather than activation?

**Dr. Lin:** Exactly. If CD28 leads to tonic signaling, it could cause the cells to burn out before they even reach the tumor. How effective can they be if they're already exhausted?

**Professor Mitchell:** But isn't the idea that CD28 stimulation could be controlled and transient, enough to activate but not exhaust? The proponents seem confident in their data.

**Dr. Lin:** Sure, in theory. But have they adequately considered the long-term implications? The immune system's balance is delicate. If we push it too far, we might compromise it.

**Professor Mitchell:** So, your primary concern is sustainability of the T-cell response?

**Dr. Lin:** Precisely. We need to ensure that these therapies don't just offer a short-term boost but a sustained, effective response. And there's the issue of reproducibility in diverse patient populations.

**Professor Mitchell:** Valid points. Perhaps more exploratory studies are needed, particularly with varied demographics. Maybe a phased approach to the mandate would be wiser?

**Dr. Lin:** I agree. We can't afford to rush this. Precision in immunotherapy is crucial, and we must map out all possible conflicts before fully embracing such changes.

**Professor Mitchell:** Let's propose a detailed review, then. Better to proceed cautiously than to leap blindly into potential setbacks.

**Dr. Lin:** Absolutely. Understanding the nuances of CD28's role is key before we redefine our therapeutic strategies.
