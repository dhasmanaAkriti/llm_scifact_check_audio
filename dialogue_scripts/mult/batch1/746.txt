Dr. Morgan (Practitioner): Dr. Ellis, may I have a moment? I've just analyzed the latest data on MafA. It appears that phosphorylation enhances its ubiquitination.

Dr. Ellis (Decision-Maker): Phosphorylation, you say? That's a bold claim, Dr. Morgan. What evidence do you have to back this up?

Dr. Morgan: We've run several assays. The phosphorylation sites on MafA are clearly correlated with increased ubiquitination levels. This could redefine our approach to targeting beta-cell degradation.

Dr. Ellis: Hmm, and how consistent are these findings? Anomalies in such a delicate process could lead us astray.

Dr. Morgan: I understand the stakes. We've repeated the experiments under varying conditions, and the results are consistent. This phosphorylation seems to act as a signal for ubiquitination.

Dr. Ellis: If true, this could pivot our entire research direction. But, Dr. Morgan, we must be certain. Has this been peer-reviewed?

Dr. Morgan: Not yet. I wanted to ensure it was solid before submission. But given the potential implications, I thought it prudent to bring it to your attention first.

Dr. Ellis: I appreciate your diligence, but we must tread carefully. The funding board won't entertain unverified claims.

Dr. Morgan: Of course. But if validated, this could lead to breakthroughs in diabetes treatment.

Dr. Ellis: Agreed. If your data holds, it could be groundbreaking. Let's have an independent team verify your results. Then we can proceed with confidence.

Dr. Morgan: I anticipated that. I've already contacted Dr. Singh's lab. They're ready to collaborate.

Dr. Ellis: Excellent initiative. Keep me updated on their progress. If this pans out, it could change the landscape of our research.

Dr. Morgan: I will, Dr. Ellis. Thank you for your support.

Dr. Ellis: You're welcome. Let’s ensure this is rock-solid.
