Practitioner: Dr. Evans, the latest data suggests that CD28 signals regulate the trafficking of murine auto-reactive T cells into target tissues. This could be a breakthrough for our autoimmune research.

Decision-Maker: Interesting, Dr. Patel. But before we proceed with allocating resources, we need to address the potential risks. What makes you so sure this isn't another dead-end?

Practitioner: Well, the experiments show consistent results. Blocking CD28 signals in mice results in decreased T cell infiltration in tissues. This correlates with reduced autoimmune symptoms.

Decision-Maker: I understand, but we've encountered promising results before that didn't translate to human models. Could this be one of those cases?

Practitioner: That's a valid concern. However, our methodology employs more sophisticated genetic markers this time, which increases the likelihood of similar responses in humans.

Decision-Maker: Yet, there's still a financial risk. If we invest in this direction and it's flawed, we face serious budget cuts elsewhere. How do you plan to mitigate that?

Practitioner: By conducting parallel studies with humanized mouse models. This dual approach will provide clearer insights before committing to clinical trials.

Decision-Maker: And if those studies don't align with your initial hypothesis?

Practitioner: Then we'll have identified a crucial variable early. Knowledge of what doesn't work is as valuable as knowing what does, especially in high-stakes research.

Decision-Maker: You're confident this is the right course, despite the potential setbacks?

Practitioner: I am. The preliminary data is robust, and the implications for autoimmune treatment are too significant to ignore. The potential benefits outweigh the risks.

Decision-Maker: Alright, Dr. Patel, let's proceed with caution. But keep me updated at every stage. We can't afford any missteps.

Practitioner: Absolutely, Dr. Evans. Your trust will be well-placed.

Decision-Maker: We'll see. I'm counting on you to prove it.
