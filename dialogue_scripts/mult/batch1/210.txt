Dr. Collins: Ah, Sarah, I hear you’ve been working intensely on the COPI coatmer project. I’m curious about your findings.

Sarah: Yes, Dr. Collins. I’m convinced that the COPI coatmer is crucial for lipid homeostasis. It’s more than just vesicle transport.

Dr. Collins: Interesting claim. But you’re aware that our current funding hinges on COPI’s established role in cellular transport, right?

Sarah: I understand that, but ignoring its role in lipid regulation could risk our research being outdated, or worse, irrelevant.

Dr. Collins: That’s a bold statement. We have decades of data supporting COPI’s traditional functions. Can you substantiate your claim with equally rigorous evidence?

Sarah: I’ve been replicating some of the experiments and noticed consistent modulation in lipid levels when COPI function is altered. There’s a pattern that can’t be ignored.

Dr. Collins: Patterns, Sarah, are not facts. They might lead us to new questions, but we can’t base our strategy on them yet.

Sarah: But Dr. Collins, if we don’t explore this, we risk missing out on a breakthrough. Other teams might catch on and publish first.

Dr. Collins: True, but we also risk spreading ourselves too thin and losing focus on our primary objectives.

Sarah: So, you’re saying we should just stick to the safe route, even if it means potentially overlooking a significant aspect of COPI?

Dr. Collins: I’m saying we need a balance. If you can provide more definitive proof, we might consider a dual approach. Until then, our priority remains clear.

Sarah: I understand, but can we at least allocate some resources to explore this further?

Dr. Collins: We’ll review your data in the upcoming meeting. Convince the team, and you might have your wish. Until then, stay focused.

Sarah: Thank you, Dr. Collins. I’ll prepare the necessary evidence.
