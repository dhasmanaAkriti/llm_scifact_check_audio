Advocate: With the new healthcare policy emphasizing personalized medicine, it's crucial to understand how our immune system operates at a cellular level. One key insight is how during the primary early antibody response, activated B cells migrate toward the inner- and outer-follicular areas where oxysterol accumulation is generated by stromal cells.

Skeptic: I see where you're going, but isn't that a bit speculative? I mean, how can we be sure about this complex interaction?

Advocate: It's not just speculation. There’s a body of recent research supporting this. The role of oxysterols in B cell migration is increasingly recognized in immunology.

Skeptic: But isn't this just a small piece of the puzzle? How does this align with the broader implications of the new policy?

Advocate: The policy encourages tailored treatments, right? Knowing B cell migration patterns can lead to more effective vaccines and therapies. It’s about enhancing our response to diseases at a personal level.

Skeptic: I get that, but are we not jumping the gun here? The policy might be asking for immediate, actionable insights, not theories that are still under investigation.

Advocate: True, but integrating these findings gradually can transform preventive medicine. We need a shared understanding of science to move forward effectively. 

Skeptic: Fair point. Perhaps a balanced approach? We acknowledge the ongoing research while focusing on established practices?

Advocate: Exactly. We aim for alignment between cutting-edge science and practical healthcare applications. It's a way to prepare for future shifts in treatment paradigms.

Skeptic: Okay, I’m on board with that. We can present both the promising research and current applications to the policymakers.

Advocate: Great! Together, we can bridge the gap between theory and practice, ensuring the new policy truly benefits everyone.

Skeptic: Let's get to work then. We have a lot to align on before the next meeting.
