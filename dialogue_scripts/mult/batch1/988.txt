**Dr. Evans (Practitioner):** So, as many of you know, the new research policy mandates that we prioritize funding for studies on evolutionarily conserved structures. This has sparked quite a bit of discussion about pseudoknots. 

**Ms. Carter (Decision-Maker):** Yes, Dr. Evans, I've heard the arguments. But why exactly should we care about pseudoknots if they're not conserved in most eukaryotes?

**Dr. Evans:** Well, that's exactly the point. The research suggests that pseudoknots are not evolutionarily conserved across most eukaryotes. This challenges the assumption that all non-conserved structures are less important.

**Ms. Carter:** But isn't conservation a marker of significance in evolutionary biology?

**Dr. Evans:** Typically, yes. However, pseudoknots, despite their lack of conservation, play critical roles in RNA structure and function. They are involved in processes like translation and regulation which are vital to cellular functioning.

**Ms. Carter:** So, you're saying that investing in pseudoknot research could reveal insights into these fundamental processes?

**Dr. Evans:** Precisely. Ignoring them due to their lack of conservation could mean missing out on understanding complex regulatory mechanisms.

**Ms. Carter:** But how do we justify the allocation of resources to something most policies don't prioritize?

**Dr. Evans:** We need to adjust our criteria. If we focus solely on conserved structures, we limit our scope. By exploring pseudoknots, we might discover novel therapeutic targets or even new biological principles.

**Ms. Carter:** You're proposing a shift in perspective then? 

**Dr. Evans:** Exactly. We must broaden our research horizons to include non-conserved elements that have the potential to redefine what we understand in molecular biology. 

**Ms. Carter:** Alright, Dr. Evans. You've made a compelling case. I'll consider this for the next funding cycle. Let’s see some proposals that highlight the potential impacts of pseudoknot research.

**Dr. Evans:** Thank you, Ms. Carter. I’m confident that with the right focus, we can uncover groundbreaking findings.
