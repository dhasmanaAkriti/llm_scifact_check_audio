**Dr. Hayes (Advocate):** Well, with the new health policy mandating supplements for children, it's crucial we examine the evidence. The claim that long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids have no significant effect on wheezing or asthma at 3 and 6 years is quite compelling.

**Dr. Russo (Skeptic):** Compelling? Perhaps. But definitive? Not quite, Dr. Hayes. I mean, the data is still evolving, and the variables in these studies are vast.

**Dr. Hayes:** But the findings are consistent across multiple studies. The supplementation shows no significant impact on asthma symptoms long-term. Isn't that something we should consider before endorsing mandatory supplementation?

**Dr. Russo:** I agree we need to be cautious, but we shouldn't dismiss the potential benefits of these fatty acids in other areas, like cognitive development. The policy isn't solely about respiratory issues.

**Dr. Hayes:** Certainly, but the policy is specifically targeting asthma and wheezing prevention as a justification. If the evidence doesn't support that, isn't it misleading?

**Dr. Russo:** Misleading might be too strong. It's more about holistic health benefits, Dr. Hayes. We're not just treating symptoms; we're encouraging overall well-being.

**Dr. Hayes:** True, but shouldn't the primary focus be on evidence-backed outcomes? Parents trust these policies to be scientifically sound. If we're promoting these supplements without solid evidence for asthma, what message does that send?

**Dr. Russo:** Fair point. But the nuances of nutrition science require us to look beyond singular outcomes. The public health benefit might emerge in unexpected ways.

**Dr. Hayes:** I understand, but clarity is key. If the policy is based on premature conclusions about asthma, we need to rectify that before implementation. Wouldn't you agree?

**Dr. Russo:** Perhaps we need more targeted research. But for now, the comprehensive benefits of nutrition might outweigh the lack of specific evidence in asthma. Let's discuss further with the committee.

**Dr. Hayes:** Agreed. Transparency and evidence should guide us. Let's ensure we're on the right path for the sake of the children.
