Advocate: Good afternoon, Dr. Collins. I wanted to discuss the recent policy proposal to increase funding for fracture prevention programs in schools. The proposal cites the claim that the peak incidence of fractures occurs during the pubertal growth spurt in early adolescents. 

Skeptic: Ah, yes, I read that too, Dr. Hayes. But I'm not entirely convinced. I've seen studies suggesting that environmental factors, like physical activities or even nutrition, might play a more significant role in fracture incidence than just biological growth spurts.

Advocate: That's a fair point. However, the hormonal changes during puberty can lead to rapid bone growth, which, if not matched with equivalent bone strengthening, could explain the vulnerability. The data supports an increase in fractures during these years.

Skeptic: But isn't it also true that increased physical activity during adolescence could contribute to more fractures? Kids are more active, joining sports teams, and that naturally increases the risk of accidents.

Advocate: Absolutely, greater activity is a factor. However, the policy aims to address both the biological and environmental aspects by implementing both educational and physical programs to strengthen bones and prevent injuries.

Skeptic: I see. So, the focus is on a comprehensive approach, not just targeting the biological aspect. But how do we ensure that these programs are effective and not just another bureaucratic layer?

Advocate: The policy includes a provision for regular evaluations and adjustments based on the latest research and feedback from schools. It's about creating a dynamic program that adapts to the needs of the students.

Skeptic: That does sound more promising. With proper evaluation, we can ensure the program remains relevant and effective. I suppose aligning our resources with this comprehensive approach could indeed be beneficial.

Advocate: I'm glad we could find some common ground. After all, our goal is to protect and educate our youth effectively.

Skeptic: Agreed, Dr. Hayes. Let's work on ensuring this policy benefits the students as intended.
