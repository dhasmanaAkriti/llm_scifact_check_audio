Dr. Millard: Alright, everyone, let’s get started. Our latest data suggests that the absence of FGF21 in mice leads to an increase in life expectancy. 

Dr. Patel: Yes, I’ve reviewed the data, but isn't there a potential risk to this? FGF21 is involved in metabolic processes. Could the absence lead to unforeseen health issues?

Dr. Millard: Ah, that’s precisely the concern. However, the current findings show that these mice not only live longer but also maintain healthier metabolic profiles.

Dr. Patel: But what about the implications for human research? If we’re considering translating this to human models, the cost of ignoring FGF21’s role could be significant.

Dr. Millard: True, and that’s why we need to deliberate carefully. The strategic choice here is whether to pursue this line of research aggressively or to proceed with caution.

Dr. Patel: So, let’s define the disagreement. I argue that without understanding the full spectrum of FGF21’s functions, we’re venturing into risky territory.

Dr. Millard: And I counter that the benefits observed, such as enhanced lifespan and healthspan, warrant further investigation. The potential upside is too considerable to ignore.

Dr. Patel: But at what potential cost? We must consider the ethical implications of reducing a critical protein without fully understanding the long-term effects.

Dr. Millard: Which is why our next step should be a comprehensive risk assessment. We need to map out all possible adverse outcomes and weigh them against the benefits.

Dr. Patel: Agreed, but let’s ensure that our strategic plan includes robust safety measures and ethical considerations. We owe it to the scientific community—and to the public.

Dr. Millard: Absolutely. Let’s convene a task force to draft a proposal that reflects these concerns. That way, we can move forward with both innovation and responsibility in mind.

Dr. Patel: That sounds like a prudent approach. Let’s keep the dialogue open as we progress.
