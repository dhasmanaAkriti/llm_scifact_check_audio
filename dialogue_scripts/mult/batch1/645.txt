Dr. Miller: Good afternoon, Ms. Hart. I understand you're concerned about the folic acid and vitamin B6 supplements you’ve been taking?

Ms. Hart: Yes, exactly. I read that these might actually increase homocysteine levels, which is not what I want. I thought they were supposed to be beneficial.

Dr. Miller: That's a common belief, yes. The primary function of folic acid and vitamin B6 is to help reduce homocysteine levels, not increase them. Where did you hear otherwise?

Ms. Hart: I came across an article online that said they could actually raise homocysteine levels, which worried me. I want to make sure I'm not harming my health.

Dr. Miller: I see. The science is quite clear on this. When used correctly, these vitamins help lower homocysteine levels. However, there might be exceptions in cases of improper dosage or specific medical conditions. Did the article mention anything like that?

Ms. Hart: No, it was rather vague and more about the potential risks without much context. Are you saying the dosage is crucial?

Dr. Miller: Precisely. Excessive intake can lead to unintended effects, but in standard doses, they are usually safe and effective for most people. Have you had your levels checked recently?

Ms. Hart: Not recently. I assumed the supplements were doing their job. Should I get tested?

Dr. Miller: It would be a prudent step. That way, we can tailor your supplement intake based on your needs rather than assumptions. 

Ms. Hart: That sounds reasonable. I just want to ensure I'm doing the right thing for my health.

Dr. Miller: Absolutely, and that's what we're here to ensure. Let’s arrange a test and review the results together. 

Ms. Hart: Thank you, Dr. Miller. I appreciate the clarification and guidance.

Dr. Miller: Anytime, Ms. Hart. Your health is our priority.
