Speaker 1: I've been reviewing the latest paper on BCL-2 and c-Myc. It claims BCL-2 actually promotes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc, contrary to previous assumptions. 

Speaker 2: That sounds counterintuitive. I thought BCL-2 was always an anti-apoptotic agent. How does this change our understanding of the pathway?

Speaker 1: Well, the paper suggests under certain conditions, BCL-2 enhances c-Myc-driven apoptosis. It seems context and cellular environment play a bigger role than we thought.

Speaker 2: Interesting, but if the results are accurate, there could be significant implications for our current research. Our project could be at risk if we're working with outdated assumptions.

Speaker 1: Exactly. That's why I'm thinking we need to reassess our experimental design. It could mean altering our approach to targeting these pathways in cancer cells.

Speaker 2: But wouldn't that require additional resources, not to mention time? We have deadlines to consider.

Speaker 1: True, but weighing the potential long-term benefits, it might be worth it. If we proceed without considering this new data, we risk basing our conclusions on flawed premises.

Speaker 2: Fair point. If BCL-2 can switch roles depending on the context, then our therapeutic strategies could either fail or produce unexpected results.

Speaker 1: So, should we propose a pilot study to test these conditions in our system? It could give us clearer insights without a full-scale overhaul.

Speaker 2: That sounds like a reasonable compromise. We gather preliminary data and decide on broader changes based on those findings.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Let's draft a proposal. It might cause a delay now, but it could save us from larger setbacks later.

Speaker 2: I'll start gathering the necessary background information and resources. Better to adapt now than regret later.

Speaker 1: Exactly. Let's get on it.
