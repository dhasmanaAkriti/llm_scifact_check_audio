Dr. Lewis: So, Dr. Patel, with the new policy emphasizing genome stability research, I'm keen on highlighting the role of genes involved in pre-mRNA splicing. They significantly impact genome stability, wouldn't you agree?

Dr. Patel: Well, Dr. Lewis, I'm not entirely convinced. While pre-mRNA splicing is crucial, I think its impact on genome stability might be overstated. There are many factors at play.

Dr. Lewis: True, but consider recent studies showing that errors in splicing can lead to genomic instability, which is a precursor to various disorders. Isn't that worth exploring further under the new policy?

Dr. Patel: Those studies have limitations, though. They often focus on specific cell lines or conditions that might not represent broader biological processes.

Dr. Lewis: Fair point, but the evidence is mounting. Look at the work by Dr. Kim's team—they demonstrated that splicing disruptions could lead to DNA damage responses in multiple systems.

Dr. Patel: I read that, but replication in other labs has been inconsistent. We need robust, reproducible data before prioritizing this direction.

Dr. Lewis: That's why I propose a joint study to address these discrepancies. If we pool our resources, we could achieve more comprehensive results.

Dr. Patel: I suppose a collaborative approach could yield more definitive answers. But we must be cautious not to overemphasize splicing at the expense of other genome stability factors.

Dr. Lewis: Absolutely, balance is key. Our goal should be to align our research focus with the new policy while remaining open to alternative pathways.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's draft a proposal that incorporates a broader perspective on genome stability, with splicing as a central, but not exclusive, component.

Dr. Lewis: Sounds like a plan. I'll set up a meeting next week to hash out the details. Together, we can make a compelling case.

Dr. Patel: Looking forward to it, Dr. Lewis. Collaboration might just be the key to unlocking this puzzle.
