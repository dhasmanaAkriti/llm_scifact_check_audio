Speaker 1: Recently, there's been a new policy mandating increased funding for research into immune complex triggered cell death. The claim is that it leads to the extracellular release of nuclear DNA, which could revolutionize our understanding of autoimmune diseases.

Speaker 2: But isn't that jumping the gun a bit? I mean, immune complexes have been studied for years, and suddenly we're supposed to accept that they cause cell death leading to DNA release without more concrete evidence?

Speaker 1: Well, the recent studies have shown promising results. The extracellular DNA can act as a danger signal, influencing immune responses. The implications for treating autoimmune conditions could be significant.

Speaker 2: But aren't these results preliminary at best? The leap from lab to real-world application is huge. We can't just change policy based on early-stage research.

Speaker 1: I understand the hesitation, but the external mandate aims to encourage further investigation. We need to explore every possibility, especially when it comes to potential breakthroughs in medical science.

Speaker 2: Sure, but shouldn't the focus be on more established mechanisms before allocating significant resources? What if this path turns out to be a dead end?

Speaker 1: That’s always a risk in scientific research, but that's why it's important to keep an open mind. The potential for discovering new therapeutic targets makes it worth the investment.

Speaker 2: But what about peer review and replication? Have other labs been able to replicate these findings consistently?

Speaker 1: That's exactly what the increased funding is intended for. To ensure that these findings are verified and that any new treatments developed are both safe and effective.

Speaker 2: I suppose I see the point. But skepticism is healthy, especially with science. We need to tread carefully.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Skepticism drives us to be more rigorous and ensures that any breakthroughs we claim are genuine.

Speaker 2: Well, I'll keep my eyes on future developments, but I'm not convinced just yet.

Speaker 1: Fair enough. Science thrives on debate, after all.
