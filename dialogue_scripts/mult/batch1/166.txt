Dr. Carter: Good afternoon, everyone. I've called this meeting to discuss the recent findings about bariatric surgery and its potential impact on mental health.

Alex: Afternoon, Dr. Carter. I saw the report this morning. It seemed pretty alarming.

Dr. Carter: Yes, indeed. The data suggests a higher incidence of depression and anxiety post-surgery than we previously thought.

Alex: But aren't there significant physical health benefits? I mean, the weight loss, the reduction in diabetes risk...

Dr. Carter: Absolutely, the physical benefits are well-documented. But we can't ignore the psychological ramifications. As healthcare providers, we need to consider the whole patient.

Alex: So what's the plan? Are we recommending changes to the surgery protocol or more pre-surgery counseling?

Dr. Carter: Well, that's what we need to decide. The study advocates for enhanced psychological evaluations before surgery and more robust mental health support afterward.

Alex: That sounds reasonable. But we also have to think about resources. Our mental health services are already stretched thin.

Dr. Carter: True. But we need to find a balance. Perhaps introducing a pilot program could help us assess the feasibility before a full rollout.

Alex: I like that idea. We could start with patients at higher risk for mental health issues, based on their evaluations.

Dr. Carter: Exactly. We should also liaise with our mental health teams to streamline the referral process.

Alex: Agreed. And maybe we could collect data to evaluate the program's success?

Dr. Carter: That's crucial. We need evidence to support any long-term changes. Let's outline a proposal and present it at the next board meeting.

Alex: Sounds like a plan, Dr. Carter. I'll start drafting the proposal and coordinate with the mental health department.

Dr. Carter: Thank you, Alex. Let's ensure we're providing our patients with the best comprehensive care possible.
