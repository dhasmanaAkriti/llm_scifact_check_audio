Dr. Bennett: Good afternoon, everyone. As you're aware, the new policy mandates a focus on innovative cancer treatments, particularly the expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides. This is a significant shift for our research direction.

Dr. Patel: Afternoon, Dr. Bennett. It's exciting, but also a bit daunting. How exactly does expressing these antigens provide additional protection against relapse?

Dr. Bennett: Well, Dr. Patel, the theory is that by presenting these antigens as peptides, we can engage the immune system more effectively. It essentially trains the body to recognize and attack cancer cells if they recur.

Dr. Patel: So, it's like setting up a future defense system?

Dr. Bennett: Precisely. The immune system is given a 'memory', if you will, of what to target. This approach is supposed to reduce the chances of relapse significantly.

Dr. Patel: But isn't there a risk of the immune system being overstimulated or attacking healthy cells?

Dr. Bennett: That's a valid concern. The challenge is ensuring specificity, that the immune response targets only cancer cells. It's why precise peptide design and delivery are crucial.

Dr. Patel: I see. So, our role would be to optimize these peptides for maximum efficacy and safety?

Dr. Bennett: Exactly. We need to align our efforts with the policy's objectives and ensure our research meets the required standards for safety and innovation.

Dr. Patel: Understood. It sounds like a collaborative effort across the board. Aligning with this new direction will require all hands on deck.

Dr. Bennett: Indeed, Dr. Patel. It's a complex task, but I believe with our team's expertise, we can contribute significantly to this promising field.

Dr. Patel: I’m on board. Let's get started on brainstorming how our team can best approach this.

Dr. Bennett: Excellent. I’ll schedule a follow-up session to dive deeper into specifics. Thank you for your enthusiasm, Dr. Patel.

Dr. Patel: Thank you, Dr. Bennett. Looking forward to the challenge.
