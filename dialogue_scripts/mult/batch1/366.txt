Speaker 1: So, the claim is that ERAP1 SNPs are epistatic to HLA alleles for ankylosing spondylitis. That’s quite a mouthful, isn’t it?

Speaker 2: It is, but the implications are huge. If ERAP1 SNPs can actually modify the effect of HLA alleles, we're talking about a potential game-changer in treatment strategies.

Speaker 1: Exactly. Imagine targeting ERAP1 specifically for patients with those particular HLA alleles. It could personalize medicine to a whole new level.

Speaker 2: True, but before we jump to conclusions, we need to dissect the data thoroughly. Have you seen the latest study results?

Speaker 1: I have. The correlation seems robust, but it’s still early days. We need more replication studies to be certain.

Speaker 2: Definitely. But this could open up funding opportunities for further research. If we can get a grant, we could lead the next study ourselves.

Speaker 1: That’s the opportunity I was thinking about. But should we pitch it now, or wait until more data comes in?

Speaker 2: I’d say let’s draft a preliminary proposal. We can outline the potential and the need for further research. If we wait too long, someone else might seize the opportunity.

Speaker 1: Good point. We should act quickly but strategically. Let’s put together a team meeting to brainstorm and assign tasks. 

Speaker 2: Agreed. We’ll need to ensure we have a solid foundation before approaching potential partners or funding bodies.

Speaker 1: I'll start gathering the team. We should aim to have a draft ready by next week.

Speaker 2: Perfect. Let's make this count.

Speaker 1: Alright, let’s get to work. We might just be on the verge of something big here.

Speaker 2: Here’s hoping! But caution and diligence will be key.
