Advocate: So, here’s the crux, Jane. The research shows that a deficiency of FGF21 in mice leads to atherosclerotic plaque formation. This could be a breakthrough in understanding heart disease.

Skeptic: But Tom, isn’t that jumping the gun a bit? We’re talking about mice here. How can we be sure it translates to humans?

Advocate: Fair point. But the physiological mechanisms are quite similar. If we ignore this, we risk overlooking a potential preventive measure for humans.

Skeptic: I get that, but we’ve seen promising results in mice before that didn’t pan out for humans. What makes this different?

Advocate: The consistency of the data. Multiple studies have shown the same correlation. Plus, with the global rise in heart disease, can we afford not to pursue every possible lead?

Skeptic: We need to be cautious though. There's a financial risk in redirecting resources to something that might not yield human benefits.

Advocate: True, but isn’t the greater risk doing nothing? If this pans out, it could redefine cardiovascular treatment strategies.

Skeptic: I’m not against exploring it, Tom. I just think we need more conclusive evidence. What about potential side effects in humans?

Advocate: That’s a valid concern. Preclinical trials could help us evaluate that. But dismissing this out of hand could cost us a huge opportunity.

Skeptic: I’m not dismissing it. I just want to ensure we're not putting all our eggs in one basket. We should look at other factors too, like diet and lifestyle.

Advocate: Absolutely, but FGF21 is a piece of the puzzle we can’t ignore. We need a strategy that includes all angles, and this could be a crucial one.

Skeptic: Let’s agree to explore it further without jumping to conclusions. We’ll need a balanced approach moving forward.

Advocate: Agreed. A balanced approach, but with a keen eye on the potential this holds.

Skeptic: Deal. Let’s gather more data and make an informed decision.
