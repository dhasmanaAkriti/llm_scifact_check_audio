Dr. Kim: So, Alex, I read your recent paper on PTEN and SRF. You say PTEN regulates SRF's transcriptional activity?

Dr. Alex: That's right, Kim. Our data shows a significant interaction.

Dr. Kim: But isn't SRF a well-established transcription factor? I’m confused about PTEN's involvement. Traditionally, it's a tumor suppressor.

Dr. Alex: Exactly, it is. But our results suggest it also influences SRF, possibly altering gene expression patterns.

Dr. Kim: Interesting. But doesn't this contradict previous research that links SRF to pathways independent of PTEN?

Dr. Alex: It does challenge some assumptions, yes. Our findings suggest a more complex interplay.

Dr. Kim: How do you propose we address this contradiction in our review panel next week? It could raise some eyebrows.

Dr. Alex: I think we should present the data, emphasizing the novelty. It’s about showing the potential for new therapeutic angles.

Dr. Kim: True, but there’s a risk. If the panel sees it as speculative, it may affect our funding prospects.

Dr. Alex: That’s a valid point. But isn’t scientific progress built on challenging established paradigms? We need to decide if this is a risk worth taking.

Dr. Kim: Agreed, but we need irrefutable evidence. Could we gather more supporting data before the panel?

Dr. Alex: We could focus on additional experiments to bolster our findings. But that might delay the presentation.

Dr. Kim: Let’s weigh the options. A strong dataset could convince the panel. How about we aim for a follow-up study?

Dr. Alex: Alright, a follow-up it is. We’ll prepare the groundwork and build a solid case.

Dr. Kim: Great, let's get to it. We can redefine some boundaries here, but only with robust evidence.

Dr. Alex: Agreed. This could be groundbreaking if we proceed wisely.
