**Dr. Harris:** So, Dr. Kim, have you seen the latest findings? They claim that beta-band coherence is enhanced for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli. Quite a revelation, don’t you think?

**Dr. Kim:** I did read about it, yes. But I’m not entirely convinced. Just because a study presents new data doesn’t mean we should accept it without scrutiny.

**Dr. Harris:** That’s true, but the methodology seems sound. They used a robust sample size and state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques to measure brain activity. It’s hard to dismiss that.

**Dr. Kim:** Sure, the methodology is impressive, but I’m skeptical about the interpretation. Beta-band coherence isn’t a straightforward indicator. It could be influenced by numerous factors, like attention or task difficulty, which weren’t fully addressed.

**Dr. Harris:** I understand your caution. But if this holds true, it could have significant implications for understanding conscious perception. It might even inform new therapeutic approaches for visual impairments.

**Dr. Kim:** Potentially, yes. But we need more replication studies before making any decisions about applications. One study isn’t enough to establish a new paradigm.

**Dr. Harris:** Agreed, more research is necessary. However, given the potential benefits, shouldn’t we consider allocating resources to further investigate this phenomenon?

**Dr. Kim:** I’m open to that, but with a condition. We should design a study that specifically controls for those other influencing factors. Only then can we confidently interpret beta-band coherence in relation to visibility.

**Dr. Harris:** That sounds reasonable. Let's propose a collaborative study to delve deeper. We can draft a proposal to present at the next departmental meeting.

**Dr. Kim:** That’s a plan I can get behind. Let’s ensure we keep our standards rigorous and our minds open.

**Dr. Harris:** Absolutely. It’s exciting to be at the forefront of such intriguing research, isn’t it?

**Dr. Kim:** It is indeed. Here’s to new discoveries and deeper understanding.
