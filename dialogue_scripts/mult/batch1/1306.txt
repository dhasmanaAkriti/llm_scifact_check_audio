Dr. Evans: Good afternoon, everyone. As you know, the new policy mandates that all research proposals involving TLR signaling in MDS must undergo a strategic review. Let's dive into what that means for our ongoing projects.

Dr. Patel: Afternoon, Dr. Evans. The policy seems to imply we need to reassess our research trajectory, especially with the TLR signaling pathways. But isn't our current focus already aligned with the policy's goals?

Dr. Evans: Indeed, Dr. Patel. Our research does align, but the mandate emphasizes a comprehensive analysis of potential therapeutic targets. We're expected to choose actionable strategies that can translate into clinical applications.

Dr. Patel: Right, but that means a shift from basic research to more translational approaches, which could require additional resources. Are we prepared for that?

Dr. Evans: That's precisely why we're here—to decide whether to pivot our focus or continue as is. The authority expects us to demonstrate tangible progress, possibly through clinical trials.

Dr. Patel: I understand the pressure for actionable outcomes, but the foundational work is crucial. Jumping to clinical applications might be premature without thorough understanding.

Dr. Evans: I agree, Dr. Patel. However, the external mandate is clear. If we choose to remain within the sphere of basic research, we might face funding challenges.

Dr. Patel: So, it comes down to balancing immediate impact with long-term discovery. What are our best options?

Dr. Evans: We could pursue a hybrid approach—continue fundamental research while identifying key TLR targets for potential therapeutic development. This might satisfy both the mandate and our scientific curiosity.

Dr. Patel: That sounds feasible, Dr. Evans. It allows us to maintain scientific integrity while adapting to the new policy. Shall we draft a proposal outlining this dual approach?

Dr. Evans: Yes, let's proceed with that plan. We'll present our proposal to the review board next week. This way, we can continue our important work while adhering to the policy.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. I'll start compiling the necessary data. Thank you, Dr. Evans.

Dr. Evans: Thank you, everyone. Let's make this work for the benefit of science and society.
