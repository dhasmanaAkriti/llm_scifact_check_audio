Advocate: We've just received the latest findings, and it looks like two variants of chromosome 6q21 are linked with radiation therapy-induced second malignancies in pediatric Hodgkin lymphoma patients. It's a significant breakthrough.

Skeptic: Interesting, but how reliable is this data? I mean, genetic studies can be quite complex and often lead us down the wrong path.

Advocate: Sure, complexity is a factor, but this study was thorough. It involved a large cohort, and the results were statistically significant. This could change how we approach treatment plans for these young patients.

Skeptic: I understand the excitement, but haven't we been here before? New genetic markers get discovered, and then they don't hold up under further scrutiny. I just want to be sure we're not jumping the gun.

Advocate: That's a fair point. But if these findings hold, we could tailor radiation therapy to reduce the risk of secondary cancers. Imagine the potential impact on survival rates and quality of life.

Skeptic: I'm not against the potential, but what about the cost and feasibility? How do we incorporate this into current practices without overwhelming the system?

Advocate: That's why we're having this discussion. We need to develop a strategic plan, maybe initiate pilot programs to integrate genetic screening. We can't ignore the possibilities because of logistical challenges.

Skeptic: I'm open to exploring this further, but let's ensure we have a balanced approach. We need more peer reviews and perhaps a few corroborative studies.

Advocate: Absolutely, alignment is key. Let's bring this to the next board meeting, gather more insights, and see how we can move forward responsibly. 

Skeptic: Agreed. If this holds up, it could be a game-changer. Let's make sure we're ready to address all angles.

Advocate: Perfect. Together, we can make informed decisions for the betterment of our patients.
