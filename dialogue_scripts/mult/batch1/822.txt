Advocate: Look, Sarah, the N348I mutation clearly causes resistance to nevirapine. The data from multiple studies support this.

Skeptic: I get that, Alex, but aren't you jumping to conclusions? Just because there's a correlation doesn't mean it's the only factor.

Advocate: This isn't just correlation. We're talking about a significant decrease in drug efficacy directly linked to this mutation. If we ignore it, patients might face serious consequences.

Skeptic: But what if we're missing something? A different mutation, perhaps? We can't just change treatment protocols without considering all variables.

Advocate: I agree, we need to be thorough. But the risk of continuing with nevirapine without addressing N348I is too high. Patients' lives are at stake here.

Skeptic: I understand the urgency. But rushing this decision could lead us to overlook critical details. A premature change might complicate treatment for those who don't have this mutation.

Advocate: That's why I'm suggesting a targeted approach. We can test for the mutation first. If present, then we switch to a different regimen. It’s a measured response, not a blanket change.

Skeptic: Testing every patient could be costly and time-consuming. Wouldn't that delay treatment?

Advocate: Possibly, but it's better than risking resistance, which would be even more costly in the long run. The threat of ineffective treatment is too great to ignore.

Skeptic: You might be right. We'll need to gather more resources for testing. I want to ensure we cover all angles before rolling out this plan.

Advocate: Absolutely, Sarah. Let’s work on it together. The goal is to protect the patients, after all.

Skeptic: Alright, Alex. Let’s draft a proposal for the team to review. We need to be certain this is the right path forward.

Advocate: Agreed. I'll get started on the data compilation. Thanks for being open to this, Sarah.

Skeptic: No problem. We're in this together, for the patients' sake.
