**Dr. Collins (Advocate):** So, Sarah, you’ve heard about the recent study, right? Helminths interfering with immune system control of coinfections by microbial pathogens. It’s quite a revelation.

**Dr. Ramirez (Skeptic):** Yes, I’ve read it. But I’m not convinced it’s as groundbreaking as it sounds. We’ve seen claims about helminths before.

**Dr. Collins:** True, but this study provides new insights. The data shows a significant impact on immune response. It’s like they’ve found a missing piece of the puzzle.

**Dr. Ramirez:** But the sample size was small, wasn't it? And the conditions were controlled. How do we know it applies broadly to human populations?

**Dr. Collins:** That’s a valid point, but the mechanisms they describe are quite compelling. The helminths seem to modulate the immune system in a way that could explain why some infections are harder to treat.

**Dr. Ramirez:** Yet, we need more than mechanisms. We need consistent, replicable results across diverse groups. And let’s not forget the potential for confounding variables. Coinfections are complex.

**Dr. Collins:** Absolutely, but this could open doors to new therapeutic approaches. Imagine using helminths to tweak immune responses in a controlled manner.

**Dr. Ramirez:** I’m all for innovation, but we can’t ignore the risks. Introducing helminths into a system could have unforeseen consequences. We need to proceed with caution.

**Dr. Collins:** Agreed, but isn’t that the nature of scientific exploration? We take calculated risks to push boundaries.

**Dr. Ramirez:** Sure, but let’s map out those risks carefully. I’m not against the idea; I just think we need more robust evidence before we start seeing helminths as a viable solution.

**Dr. Collins:** Fair enough. So, we agree that more research is needed. Let’s define the parameters for the next steps and see where this leads us.

**Dr. Ramirez:** Sounds like a plan. We’ll keep the skepticism healthy, and the exploration thorough.
