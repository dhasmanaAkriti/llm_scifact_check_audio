**Dr. Carter (Originator):** Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we’re discussing a pivotal scientific claim that could revolutionize chemotherapy treatments. Recent studies suggest that increased vessel density, along with a reduction in fibrosis, improves the efficacy of these treatments.

**Dr. Patel (Interpreter):** Good afternoon, Dr. Carter. While the claim is intriguing, can you clarify how this aligns with the new healthcare policy mandating more efficient treatment protocols?

**Dr. Carter:** Certainly, Dr. Patel. The policy emphasizes the need for treatments that maximize patient outcomes. By enhancing vessel density and reducing fibrosis, we can ensure that chemotherapy drugs are delivered more effectively to the tumor site.

**Dr. Patel:** I see. But how do we implement this in practical terms, given the constraints of current medical infrastructure and training?

**Dr. Carter:** That's a valid concern. We propose integrating these findings into existing treatment regimens through targeted training programs for oncologists and enhanced diagnostic tools to monitor vessel density and fibrosis levels.

**Dr. Patel:** It sounds promising, but how do we ensure that these changes won't disproportionately increase costs, which could be a barrier under the current policy?

**Dr. Carter:** Excellent question. By improving treatment efficacy, we anticipate a reduction in overall treatment cycles and associated costs. Moreover, with better outcomes, we foresee reduced long-term care expenses.

**Dr. Patel:** That makes sense in theory. However, convincing the broader medical community requires concrete data. Have any pilot programs demonstrated these benefits?

**Dr. Carter:** Yes, preliminary results from a pilot study at St. Mary's Hospital show a significant increase in survival rates and a decrease in treatment duration. We're compiling these results for a peer-reviewed publication.

**Dr. Patel:** That's encouraging. If the data holds, I believe we could advocate for a controlled rollout, aligning with the policy mandate while monitoring outcomes closely.

**Dr. Carter:** Agreed. Shall we move forward with drafting a proposal to present to the healthcare board?

**Dr. Patel:** Let's do that. A collaborative approach will ensure we address all potential challenges. Thank you for leading this initiative, Dr. Carter.

**Dr. Carter:** Thank you, Dr. Patel. Together,
