Dr. Wilson: So, the claim is that Major Vault Protein, or MVP, makes tumors more aggressive by sorting miR-193a into extracellular vesicles. 

Dr. Patel: Right, that's what the recent study suggests. But I'm struggling to connect the dots. How exactly does MVP influence the aggressiveness?

Dr. Wilson: That's the point of confusion, isn't it? The hypothesis is that miR-193a has tumor suppressive properties, and its removal from the cell environment courtesy of MVP could lead to unchecked tumor growth.

Dr. Patel: So, you're saying that MVP is essentially hijacking these tumor-suppressing molecules and shipping them out of the cell?

Dr. Wilson: Precisely. By regulating miR-193a's exit, MVP might be turning down the cellular defenses.

Dr. Patel: But how do we confirm this? Do we trace the pathways of miR-193a or look at MVP's activity under different conditions?

Dr. Wilson: I think a multi-pronged approach could work. Track miR-193a's presence in EVs and simultaneously observe MVP's expression levels. 

Dr. Patel: That sounds logical. We should also consider testing MVP inhibitors to see if blocking its action changes tumor behavior.

Dr. Wilson: Yes, that would provide direct evidence of the causal link. Are you suggesting we move forward with an experimental setup?

Dr. Patel: I believe so. But let's ensure we're on the same page. This could be groundbreaking if it holds up.

Dr. Wilson: Agreed. Let's run this by the team, and if we're all in agreement, prepare the proposal for experimental funding.

Dr. Patel: Perfect. The potential to alter cancer treatment strategies with this knowledge is too significant to ignore.

Dr. Wilson: Then let's make it happen. I'll draft the initial outline, and we can refine it together.

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. Let's aim to have this ready for the next research meeting.
