Dr. Bennett: So, the data's in, and it appears TNFAIP3 is a glioblastoma tumor suppressor. 

Dr. Harper: Fascinating. But wait, you've thoroughly verified this? 

Dr. Bennett: Yes, Harper. We ran multiple assays. It's consistent. TNFAIP3 suppresses tumor growth in our models. 

Dr. Harper: I don't doubt your results, Bennett. But TNFAIP3's role in inflammation—how does that align? 

Dr. Bennett: That's the thing. It modulates inflammatory pathways, which indirectly halts tumor proliferation. 

Dr. Harper: Hmm. But, if true, wouldn’t this contradict previous findings on its pro-inflammatory roles?

Dr. Bennett: That's precisely the point of contention. Our results suggest a dual function. It's context-dependent.

Dr. Harper: Context-dependent. Yet, the implications... If TNFAIP3 is truly a suppressor, our current treatment protocols might need reevaluation.

Dr. Bennett: Exactly. This discovery could shift the focus of our therapeutic strategies significantly.

Dr. Harper: But isn’t it risky to pivot without consensus across the board? We can't afford to mislead patients.

Dr. Bennett: That's why I'm bringing this to you. We need to define these conflicts and address them head-on.

Dr. Harper: Fair point. We should convene a panel. Gather all relevant data, peer-reviewed studies, and engage in a rigorous debate.

Dr. Bennett: Agreed. This discovery is too pivotal to bypass thorough scrutiny. The stakes are personal for all involved.

Dr. Harper: Then let's initiate this. Balance the excitement with necessary caution.

Dr. Bennett: Absolutely. This could redefine our understanding—and treatment—of glioblastoma.

Dr. Harper: And ensure we aren't just riding the wave of a new discovery without adequate validation.

Dr. Bennett: Exactly. Let's chart this course, Harper. Together.

Dr. Harper: Together. Let’s get to work.
