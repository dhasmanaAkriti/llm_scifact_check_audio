Dr. Keller: So, Dr. Marcus, I heard about the recent discovery regarding major vault protein and its role in miR-193a sorting. Quite fascinating, isn't it?

Dr. Marcus: Absolutely, Dr. Keller. The data suggests that major vault protein is crucial in regulating the sorting of tumor suppressive miR-193a into extracellular vesicles. This could be groundbreaking for cancer research.

Dr. Keller: Indeed. But before we proceed, could you elaborate on how this impacts our current understanding of extracellular vesicle sorting?

Dr. Marcus: Certainly. Traditionally, we've focused on the vesicle's lipid and protein composition, but this discovery shifts our attention to specific proteins like major vault protein as active regulators. It implies a targeted sorting mechanism for miR-193a, which could be pivotal in tumor suppression.

Dr. Keller: That aligns with the hypothesis we discussed last month. How reliable is the data? Have the results been replicated across different cell lines?

Dr. Marcus: The initial study was robust, utilizing multiple cell lines and confirming the role of major vault protein. However, wider replication and peer review are needed for validation.

Dr. Keller: Understood. Given this, should we consider integrating this mechanism into our ongoing cancer therapy research?

Dr. Marcus: I believe we should. Identifying how to manipulate major vault protein could enhance miR-193a delivery, potentially increasing the efficacy of cancer treatments. But, we must tread carefully and ensure further validation.

Dr. Keller: Agreed. Let's propose a pilot study to our board. This could be a significant step forward, but we must ensure our approach is scientifically sound and ethically responsible.

Dr. Marcus: I'll draft a proposal outlining our objectives and methodology. We can review it together before presenting. 

Dr. Keller: Perfect. Let's make sure we have a solid foundation. This could be an opportunity to truly advance our understanding and treatment of cancer.
