**Dr. Kim:** So, there's a growing body of research suggesting elevated cell-free mitochondrial DNA levels are associated with mortality. It's quite concerning.

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, I've read a few papers on that. The implication is quite significant if the correlation holds true.

**Dr. Kim:** Indeed. If these levels are indicative of cellular stress or damage, it could be a predictive marker for early intervention.

**Dr. Patel:** But doesn't that also mean we need to rethink our current diagnostic protocols? This could be a huge shift in how we assess patient risk.

**Dr. Kim:** Exactly. The threat here is missing out on a potentially crucial biomarker. If these levels are truly indicative of mortality risk, not integrating them could be detrimental to patient outcomes.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but we need more extensive studies to establish causation, don't we? Correlation alone can't drive clinical decisions.

**Dr. Kim:** Agreed. However, ignoring the potential could delay advancements in predictive medicine. What do you think would be a reasonable approach?

**Dr. Patel:** Well, perhaps integrating it into a multi-factor model could be a starting point. It would allow us to assess its predictive power without overhauling existing systems prematurely.

**Dr. Kim:** That sounds pragmatic. Incorporating it as part of a larger diagnostic framework could help us gather more data while minimizing risk.

**Dr. Patel:** And if further studies corroborate its significance, we can then advocate for broader clinical adoption. 

**Dr. Kim:** Exactly. So, we align on using it cautiously, as part of a broader diagnostic toolkit, until more definitive evidence surfaces?

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. It’s about balancing innovation with caution. Let's keep monitoring developments in this area.

**Dr. Kim:** Agreed. We should also consider submitting a proposal for a pilot study. It could contribute valuable insights.

**Dr. Patel:** Great idea. Let's draft something up and see where it takes us.
