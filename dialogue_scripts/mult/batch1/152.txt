**Dr. Waters (Originator):** Now, let’s dive into the concept of B cells and their role in the immune system. Many studies suggest that B cells go through plasmablast differentiation and antibody production by continuous expression of EBI2.

**Dr. Lee (Interpreter):** Interesting, Dr. Waters. But isn't it true that other factors beyond EBI2 are just as critical in B cell differentiation?

**Dr. Waters:** Certainly, Dr. Lee. However, recent findings emphasize EBI2’s pivotal role as a guiding factor. It's like the GPS for these cells, directing them to the right locations.

**Dr. Lee:** I see where you're coming from, but couldn't chemokines also play a significant part in this navigation process? EBI2 might not act alone.

**Dr. Waters:** You have a point. Chemokines are indeed involved, but EBI2’s continuous expression ensures that B cells maintain their migratory capability, even under varying conditions.

**Dr. Lee:** But does this imply EBI2 is indispensable, or could the immune response adapt without it? I’m trying to pinpoint where we might disagree.

**Dr. Waters:** It’s not about indispensability, but rather optimization. Without EBI2, B cells might still differentiate, but not as efficiently or accurately. The disagreement may lie in how much weight we give EBI2 compared to other factors.

**Dr. Lee:** So, we aren’t disputing EBI2's role, but its degree of influence. Perhaps we need more comparative studies between EBI2 and other factors to settle this.

**Dr. Waters:** Agreed, Dr. Lee. Let’s map out what we know and where the gaps are. This could be an opportunity for collaborative research.

**Dr. Lee:** That sounds promising. I’ll start reviewing recent data, and we can reconvene to discuss potential experiments. 

**Dr. Waters:** Excellent. Let's aim to redefine what we know about B cell differentiation together.
