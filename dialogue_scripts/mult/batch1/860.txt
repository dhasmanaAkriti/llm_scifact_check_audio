Speaker 1: Alright, so we’ve been working under the assumption that TNF is essential for granuloma formation. But this new study claims normal granulomas form in the absence of TNF in Zebrafish. 

Speaker 2: Exactly, I read that too. It kind of flips our understanding on its head, doesn’t it?

Speaker 1: Yeah. But here’s where I’m confused. If TNF isn’t necessary, what’s driving the granuloma formation then?

Speaker 2: That’s the point of contention. The study suggests other cytokines might be compensating, but doesn’t pinpoint which ones exactly.

Speaker 1: I see. But doesn’t that contradict most of what’s established in mammalian systems where TNF is pivotal?

Speaker 2: It does, and that’s why we need to dissect this further. Maybe it’s a species-specific mechanism, or perhaps TNF plays a more nuanced role than we thought.

Speaker 1: So, what are our options here? Do we pursue a comparative study with mammalian models to check for similar pathways?

Speaker 2: That’s one approach. Alternatively, we could focus on identifying these alternative pathways within Zebrafish first. That might give us clearer insights before we jump to mammals.

Speaker 1: True, but we should be cautious. If we’re going to challenge established concepts, we need robust data.

Speaker 2: Agreed. It’s a strategic gamble but could open up new therapeutic avenues if we’re right.

Speaker 1: So, we’re in agreement: explore Zebrafish pathways first, then evaluate cross-species relevance?

Speaker 2: Yes, that makes sense. It maps out the conflict clearly. We need to redefine what we thought we knew about TNF.

Speaker 1: Let’s dive into it then. We’ve got some paradigms to shake up.
