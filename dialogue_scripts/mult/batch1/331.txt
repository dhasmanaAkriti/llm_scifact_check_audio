Dr. Carter: So, Sandra, you’re suggesting Deltex interacts with eIF3. But the literature says there's no known interaction.

Sandra: That's precisely what caught my attention, Dr. Carter. I found some biochemical anomalies during our protein interaction assays.

Dr. Carter: Anomalies? Could you elaborate? We need to be cautious here—misinterpretation could lead to costly missteps.

Sandra: Of course. In our assays, Deltex consistently pulled down eIF3 subunits. It was unexpected, but consistent.

Dr. Carter: Interesting. But consistency doesn't always equate to interaction. Could it be an artifact?

Sandra: It's possible, but unlikely. We controlled for non-specific binding. Plus, the interaction was disrupted in the presence of a known eIF3 inhibitor.

Dr. Carter: That’s compelling, but we’re treading on thin ice without further evidence. We need to rule out any experimental bias.

Sandra: I agree. That’s why I propose a co-immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry. It would validate the interaction more robustly.

Dr. Carter: That would indeed be more definitive. However, there's a risk of misallocated resources if this turns out to be a dead end.

Sandra: True, but the potential implications for understanding cellular translation are worth the gamble, don't you think?

Dr. Carter: Potentially, yes. If Deltex indeed interacts with eIF3, it could unravel new regulatory pathways. But we must proceed methodically.

Sandra: Absolutely. I’m also considering collaboration with Dr. Lin's team—they’ve been working on eIF3 dynamics and could offer additional insights.

Dr. Carter: That sounds prudent. Let’s ensure all our bases are covered. Document every step meticulously. We’ll need a solid case if we want to challenge current dogma.

Sandra: Understood, Dr. Carter. I’ll get started on the co-IP and reach out to Dr. Lin. We’ll need all the evidence we can gather.

Dr. Carter: Excellent. Keep me posted on your progress. This could be groundbreaking if proven true.
