Originator: Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you a groundbreaking discovery: KRT17 modulates the expression of the transcriptional regulator AIRE in diseased epithelia.

Interpreter: That's quite a claim. Could you elaborate on how you've arrived at this conclusion?

Originator: Certainly. Our study showed a correlation between elevated KRT17 levels and altered AIRE expression in epithelial tissues affected by disease.

Interpreter: Interesting. But some of our colleagues argue that correlation does not imply causation. How do you address that?

Originator: A valid point. However, we've conducted experiments where altering KRT17 levels directly influenced AIRE expression.

Interpreter: Could you specify what kind of experiments these were?

Originator: We used CRISPR techniques to manipulate KRT17 in epithelial cells, observing subsequent changes in AIRE expression.

Interpreter: Fascinating. But isn't it possible that other factors might mediate this interaction, perhaps through a more complex regulatory network?

Originator: That's a possibility we're exploring. However, the direct nature of our results strongly suggests a primary role for KRT17.

Interpreter: I see. But some might argue that without understanding the broader network, attributing a primary role might be premature.

Originator: True, yet our findings provide a crucial piece of the puzzle, encouraging further research into this regulatory mechanism.

Interpreter: Encouraging, indeed. But for the audience, could you clarify how this discovery might impact our understanding or treatment of epithelial diseases?

Originator: Certainly. By targeting KRT17, we might modulate AIRE, offering a new therapeutic angle for diseases like alopecia or psoriasis.

Interpreter: Compelling. However, the clinical translation often presents challenges. What steps are you taking to bridge this gap?

Originator: We're collaborating with clinical researchers to design trials that will evaluate the therapeutic potential of targeting KRT17.

Interpreter: Thank you for clarifying. It seems your work opens exciting avenues, but as always, further validation is crucial.

Originator: Agreed. Science is a journey, and we're eager to continue exploring this promising path.
