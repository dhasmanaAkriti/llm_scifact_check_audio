**Dr. Smith:** Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to discuss an intriguing claim: "Beta-band coherence is diminished for visible stimuli over invisible stimuli." This could redefine our understanding of perceptual processes. 

**Dr. Patel:** Thank you, Dr. Smith. It's an interesting proposition, but I must ask, what evidence supports this claim? Many studies suggest the opposite, where coherence is stronger when stimuli are visible.

**Dr. Smith:** Quite right, Dr. Patel. However, recent EEG studies indicate that when stimuli are visible, the brain's need to process detailed information reduces coherence. It's akin to focusing a flashlight—when more details are visible, the beam narrows.

**Dr. Patel:** Yet, doesn't this contradict established theories on sensory processing, where greater coherence indicates more synchronized neural activity?

**Dr. Smith:** In typical scenarios, yes. But here, we're considering selective attention in complex environments. The brain prioritizes efficiency over sheer coherence when processing visible stimuli. Think of it as optimizing rather than maximizing.

**Dr. Patel:** I see the angle, but wouldn't that require a paradigm shift in how we interpret neural synchrony? The opportunity for advancement is clear, but the implications could be profound, even unsettling.

**Dr. Smith:** Absolutely, and that's precisely the opportunity at hand. If we validate this, it could revolutionize our approach to cognitive neuroscience, possibly improving AI models for perception.

**Dr. Patel:** True, if validated. But how do we ensure this isn't just an artifact of the experimental setup? Other factors, such as task complexity or participant variability, might skew results.

**Dr. Smith:** A valid concern. That's why replication across varied conditions is crucial. I'm not claiming we've found the definitive answer, but rather an exciting lead worth exploring.

**Dr. Patel:** I'm intrigued, Dr. Smith. Let's collaborate on this. We must scrutinize this claim thoroughly, for if it stands, the truth it reveals could indeed be groundbreaking.

**Dr. Smith:** Agreed, Dr. Patel. Together, we can validate or refute this claim, contributing significantly to our field.
