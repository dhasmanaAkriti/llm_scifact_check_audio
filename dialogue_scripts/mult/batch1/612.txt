Dr. Kim: Good afternoon, Dr. Patel. I hear there's been a breakthrough in your research regarding microtubule acetylation and its impact on LRRK2 mutations. 

Dr. Patel: Yes, indeed. We found that increased acetylation of microtubules seems to exacerbate locomotor deficits in cases with LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations.

Dr. Kim: Fascinating. But how did you conclude that it's the acetylation causing the exacerbation, and not some other interacting factor?

Dr. Patel: Our experiments showed that when we inhibited acetylation, the locomotor deficits were significantly reduced. The correlation was quite clear.

Dr. Kim: But did you consider the possibility that inhibiting acetylation might be affecting other pathways, which in turn influence locomotion?

Dr. Patel: We did control for that. We used specific inhibitors known to target only the acetylation process. Our results consistently pointed to acetylation as the primary factor.

Dr. Kim: Could there be an underlying genetic predisposition affecting your results? Perhaps something intrinsic to your sample population?

Dr. Patel: That’s a valid point. We accounted for genetic variability by utilizing a wide range of samples. The trend held across all, suggesting a broader applicability.

Dr. Kim: I see, but correlation doesn’t always imply causation. How do you address that?

Dr. Patel: True, and that’s why we're now focusing on longitudinal studies to observe these effects over time. We hope this will clarify the causal relationship.

Dr. Kim: Interesting approach. It seems you've covered many bases, but I would still recommend looking into possible confounding variables in your upcoming studies.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, Dr. Kim. We’re planning to expand our research parameters. Your insights are invaluable, as always.

Dr. Kim: Looking forward to your next set of findings. Science progresses through such rigorous discourse.

Dr. Patel: Indeed, thank you for your critical eye. It’s crucial to ensuring our conclusions are robust.
