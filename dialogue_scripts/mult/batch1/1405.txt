Speaker 1: So, Daniel, our department is tasked with implementing the new policy mandating every high school biology curriculum to include recent genetic discoveries in Arabidopsis. 

Speaker 2: Absolutely, Dr. Foley. This includes the taa1 tar1 tar2 triple mutant findings, right?

Speaker 1: Exactly. Now, how do we best explain that these mutants don’t form root meristems during embryogenesis?

Speaker 2: Well, it’s a complex topic, but I think we could simplify it. Start with how these mutants lack essential auxin biosynthesis pathways, which are crucial during the embryo's development phase. 

Speaker 1: Right, auxin is vital for root formation. But how do we convey that to students who might not yet grasp all these genetic intricacies?

Speaker 2: We could use analogies. For instance, compare it to a recipe missing key ingredients—without them, the final dish, or in this case, the root meristem, simply doesn’t form.

Speaker 1: That’s a good approach. But remember, the curriculum needs to emphasize not just the what, but also the how and why. 

Speaker 2: In that case, we could incorporate a lab module. Have students observe Arabidopsis mutants under microscopes. Seeing the physical absence of root meristems might make the concept more tangible.

Speaker 1: I like that idea. It aligns well with the experiential learning goals. But we need to decide if this will fit into the semester’s timeline.

Speaker 2: We could integrate it into the genetics unit. It’s a perfect example of genotype affecting phenotype, after all.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Let’s draft a proposal and include a timeline. We need to get the department's approval before the next academic year.

Speaker 2: I’ll start on the proposal right away. This could really enhance our students’ understanding of plant genetics.

Speaker 1: Excellent. Let's meet again next week to review the draft. We’re moving in the right direction, Daniel.

Speaker 2: Absolutely, Dr. Foley. Looking forward to it.
