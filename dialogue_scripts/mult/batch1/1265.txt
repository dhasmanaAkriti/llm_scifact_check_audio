Practitioner: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for gathering on such short notice. We have a groundbreaking discovery that could reshape our understanding of breast cancer risk factors. 

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Collins. We're eager to hear about these findings. Please, go on.

Practitioner: Certainly. Our recent study indicates that the risk of breast cancer among parous women decreases with the increased placental weight of their pregnancies.

Decision-Maker: That's intriguing. Could you elaborate on how placental weight factors into this?

Practitioner: Of course. The placenta plays a key role in hormone regulation during pregnancy. Heavier placentas may indicate higher levels of protective hormones, which could provide long-term benefits against breast cancer.

Decision-Maker: So, you're suggesting a correlation between placental weight and hormone levels that reduce cancer risk?

Practitioner: Precisely. However, it's crucial to emphasize that this is a correlation, not yet causation. Further research is required to solidify these findings.

Decision-Maker: Understood. How do you propose we proceed with this information?

Practitioner: We recommend increasing awareness among healthcare providers and incorporating placental weight as a factor in postnatal assessments. This could lead to tailored preventative strategies for women at risk.

Decision-Maker: That sounds promising. But how do we address potential skepticism from the medical community regarding these new findings?

Practitioner: By presenting comprehensive data and collaborating on further studies. Transparency in our methodology and results will be key to gaining trust and achieving alignment within the field.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's ensure that our communication strategy is robust. We need to prepare to address any concerns and emphasize the potential impact of this discovery.

Practitioner: Absolutely. With your support, we can pave the way for more targeted and effective breast cancer prevention measures.

Decision-Maker: Then let's move forward. We'll schedule a follow-up meeting to discuss next steps and outreach plans. Thank you, Dr. Collins.

Practitioner: Thank you. I look forward to working together to make a difference.
