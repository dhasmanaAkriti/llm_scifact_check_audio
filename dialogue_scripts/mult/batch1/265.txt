Dr. Matthews: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're discussing the recent policy from the National Science Council that emphasizes clathrin's role in stabilizing the spindle fiber apparatus during mitosis. 

Dr. Patel: Hi, Dr. Matthews. I read about that. They’re making it a priority in research funding, right?

Dr. Matthews: Correct. The council believes it's crucial for advancing our understanding of cell division. 

Dr. Patel: But clathrin? Isn't that mostly known for its role in endocytosis? 

Dr. Matthews: That's a common misconception. Recent studies indicate that clathrin helps maintain spindle fiber integrity during mitosis. This discovery has profound implications for cancer research.

Dr. Patel: Interesting. So, the council's mandate... it’s to encourage more studies on this?

Dr. Matthews: Precisely. They’re pushing for deeper investigations to empower researchers like us to explore therapeutic avenues. Imagine the potential in targeting clathrin in cancerous cells.

Dr. Patel: True. But I’m curious, how robust is the current evidence linking clathrin to spindle fiber stabilization?

Dr. Matthews: It’s compelling. Several peer-reviewed studies have demonstrated this secondary function. The evidence suggests clathrin forms a scaffolding network that stabilizes these fibers.

Dr. Patel: That’s fascinating. So, how do you suggest we approach this in our research?

Dr. Matthews: We could begin by examining clathrin’s interaction with spindle fibers in various cell types. Understanding these dynamics could lead us to new insights.

Dr. Patel: And I assume the funding will support such exploratory studies?

Dr. Matthews: Absolutely. The council’s policy is designed to provide resources for innovative approaches. They want to empower us to make informed decisions on our research directions.

Dr. Patel: I see. This could really open new doors for our lab. Thanks, Dr. Matthews. I feel more equipped to delve into this now.

Dr. Matthews: Great! Let’s embrace this opportunity to expand our horizons.
