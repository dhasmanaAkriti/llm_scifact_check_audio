Advocate: All right, Dr. Collins, let's address the elephant in the room. Your report suggests that the lysine histone demethylase inhibitor JIB 04 is inactive against KDM5A, correct?

Skeptic: That's exactly what my findings indicate, yes. However, I'm puzzled by your insistence that it's still worth pursuing.

Advocate: Well, given the stakes, it's crucial that we explore every potential avenue. Don't you agree that dismissing it outright might be premature?

Skeptic: Premature? The data is quite clear. JIB 04 shows no significant activity against KDM5A. It’s a dead end, scientifically speaking.

Advocate: But what if there’s an underlying mechanism we haven’t considered? Our goal is to find a viable treatment, and innovation often comes from unexpected places.

Skeptic: True, but we can't afford to chase ghosts. Our resources are limited, and focusing on a compound with no proven efficacy seems wasteful.

Advocate: I understand your caution, but remember, the stakes are not just scientific—they're personal. Patients like Emily are waiting.

Skeptic: I’m not insensitive to that, but we have to be practical. Redirecting efforts to more promising compounds could yield faster results.

Advocate: Emily’s condition is deteriorating. What if JIB 04 could be tweaked or combined with another agent to enhance its effect?

Skeptic: That’s speculative at best. We need concrete evidence before committing to another round of trials.

Advocate: And what if our hesitance costs us a breakthrough? I believe we owe it to Emily—and others like her—to explore every possibility.

Skeptic: So, what are you proposing? Another exploratory study? 

Advocate: Yes, but a targeted one. Let’s collaborate with chemists to modify JIB 04 and reassess its potential. We can’t make a decision without exhausting all options.

Skeptic: All right, but it needs to be a limited study. We can’t divert too many resources without solid leads. 

Advocate: Agreed. Let’s proceed, cautiously but optimistically. For Emily’s sake.
