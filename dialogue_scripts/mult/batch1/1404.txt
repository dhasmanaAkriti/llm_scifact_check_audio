Dr. Evans: So, Emma, the latest data on the siRNA knockdown of A20 is in. It's showing a significant slowdown in tumor progression in our murine models. This could be a breakthrough!

Emma: I saw that, Dr. Evans, but I'm not as convinced. We've been here before with promising in vivo results that don't translate in clinical settings.

Dr. Evans: True, but this isn't just any experiment. A20 is a known regulator of inflammation and immune response. By targeting it, we're essentially cutting off a critical support line for the tumor.

Emma: And yet, the complexity of tumor biology means that what works in mice doesn't always work in humans. Plus, the systemic effects of siRNA are still not fully understood. Could we be doing more harm than good?

Dr. Evans: I agree there's still much to learn, but the specificity of siRNA reduces off-target effects. The data shows reduced tumor size and less metastasis. These are concrete outcomes, Emma.

Emma: Outcomes in a controlled environment, yes. But what about immune response variability in humans? And the ethical concerns if this moves to clinical trials?

Dr. Evans: We're not rushing into trials. The next phase would involve more comprehensive studies on toxicity and immune response. The potential here, though, is too significant to ignore.

Emma: Potential, yes, but we need to tread carefully. The scientific community is littered with examples where early promise led to later disappointment. 

Dr. Evans: Absolutely, but we can't let past failures dictate our approach to new opportunities. This could redefine our understanding of tumor immunology.

Emma: Or it could lead us down another dead end. I just think we need more evidence before making any strategic decisions.

Dr. Evans: Agreed, more evidence is crucial. Let's map out a plan to address these concerns while exploring the promise this discovery holds.
