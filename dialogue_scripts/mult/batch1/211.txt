Speaker 1: So, I heard about the new policy requiring us to reevaluate our research on viral replication. It's all about COPI coatmer now.

Speaker 2: Yeah, it's a bit sudden. But, given the latest findings, it seems we have to go along with it, right?

Speaker 1: True, but I’m still not entirely convinced. I mean, COPI involved in viral replication? It sounds like a stretch.

Speaker 2: Well, the new studies suggest it plays a critical role in the transport of viral proteins. It’s a significant shift in how we understand viral mechanisms.

Speaker 1: But does that warrant completely changing our research focus? We’ve been working on other pathways for years.

Speaker 2: I get it, but the external mandate is clear. They want us to prioritize COPI in our studies. It's where the funding is heading.

Speaker 1: That’s the crux, isn’t it? The funding. But what if this direction is a dead end?

Speaker 2: It’s a risk, sure. But science is full of risks. If COPI's involvement is as impactful as they say, we could be on the verge of a breakthrough.

Speaker 1: So, we have to decide whether to pivot or stick to our current path. What’s your gut telling you?

Speaker 2: Honestly, I think we should lean into it. Even if it doesn’t pan out, the insights we gain could be valuable.

Speaker 1: You’re right. Adapting could open up new opportunities. It’s just... it feels like we’re abandoning our work.

Speaker 2: We’re not abandoning it. Think of it as evolving. We’re adding another layer to our understanding.

Speaker 1: Alright, let's do it. We’ll focus on COPI and see where it leads us. But let’s keep our previous research in the loop.

Speaker 2: Agreed. We’ll navigate this together, and who knows? Maybe we’re on the cusp of something groundbreaking.
