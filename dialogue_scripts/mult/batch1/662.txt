Dr. Carter: Good morning, everyone. As you're aware, the new policy from the National Science Authority mandates a thorough review of recent biochemical advancements. Specifically, the claim that "JMJD6 slows the hydroxylation of C-terminal lysine" has caught their attention. 

Dr. Nguyen: Yes, Dr. Carter. I've read the preliminary findings. The implications for protein regulation are significant, especially in cell differentiation.

Dr. Carter: Precisely. However, we need to ascertain the validity of these claims. The NSA is concerned about potential misapplications in therapeutic contexts.

Dr. Nguyen: Understood. If JMJD6 indeed modulates lysine hydroxylation, it could revolutionize our approach to epigenetic therapy. But how do we align the lab's direction with this mandate?

Dr. Carter: That's where our strategy comes into play. We need to conduct a series of replicative experiments. Collaboration with other institutions might be necessary to expedite this process.

Dr. Nguyen: Agreed. I propose we partner with Dr. Lee's lab. They've just concluded a related study on lysine modifications. Their insights could be invaluable.

Dr. Carter: That's a promising lead. I'll reach out to Dr. Lee to discuss a potential collaboration. Meanwhile, let's allocate resources to prioritize this study. We must ensure our methodologies are rigorous.

Dr. Nguyen: Absolutely. I'll coordinate with the team to begin preliminary experiments. We should also document our findings meticulously to present to the NSA.

Dr. Carter: Excellent. Our objective is to achieve alignment with the new policy while contributing valuable insights to the scientific community. Let's make sure we're on the same page.

Dr. Nguyen: I'm confident we can meet the NSA's requirements and advance our understanding of JMJD6's role. Thank you, Dr. Carter.

Dr. Carter: Thank you, Dr. Nguyen. Let's keep the communication lines open as we proceed.
