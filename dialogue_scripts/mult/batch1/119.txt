Dr. Patel: Good afternoon, Mr. Thompson. I noticed you’ve been looking into the recent claims about antidepressants increasing the severity of migraines.

Mr. Thompson: Yes, Dr. Patel. It’s quite concerning. I read some studies that suggest a strong correlation. As head of the committee, I’m considering recommending a review of our current prescriptions.

Dr. Patel: That’s a prudent move. However, while some data does suggest a link, it’s essential to look at the broader context. Many variables can affect migraine severity, not just medication.

Mr. Thompson: True. But if there’s a chance we're exacerbating the condition for some patients, shouldn’t we act decisively?

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, but with caution. We must differentiate between correlation and causation. The studies you mentioned often don’t account for factors like stress levels or sleep patterns, which can significantly influence migraines.

Mr. Thompson: I see. But wouldn’t it be safer to err on the side of caution and adjust treatment protocols?

Dr. Patel: Certainly, safety is paramount. However, sweeping changes without robust evidence might lead to unintended consequences. Reducing antidepressant use abruptly can worsen mental health conditions, which might indirectly increase migraine frequency.

Mr. Thompson: That’s a valid point. How do you propose we proceed to ensure both mental and physical health are optimized?

Dr. Patel: We should conduct a comprehensive review involving a multidisciplinary team, including neurologists and psychiatrists, to develop a nuanced approach. Meanwhile, monitoring and documenting patient responses could provide us with actionable insights.

Mr. Thompson: That sounds like a balanced strategy. I’ll propose forming this review board at our next executive meeting. We need to ensure we’re making informed decisions.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. I believe this will provide the clarity we need to align on the best path forward for our patients’ well-being.

Mr. Thompson: Thank you, Dr. Patel. Let’s keep the lines of communication open as we move forward.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Together, we’ll find the best course of action.
