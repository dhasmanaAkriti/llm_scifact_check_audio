**Advocate:** So, the claim is that pre-mRNAs associated with spliceosomal components are less stable than unassociated splicing substrates. It's quite a breakthrough, don't you think?

**Skeptic:** Well, it's certainly an interesting proposition, but I’m a bit confused. Why would association with spliceosomal components make pre-mRNAs less stable? Logically, shouldn’t the association offer some sort of protective effect?

**Advocate:** That's a good point, but consider this: the association is part of a dynamic process. The spliceosome is constantly assembling and disassembling. This dynamic nature can actually increase the likelihood of degradation.

**Skeptic:** Hmm, but if the spliceosome is involved in processing, wouldn’t it be more efficient for the cell to stabilize these pre-mRNAs during the process? It feels counterproductive to me.

**Advocate:** True, it seems counterintuitive. However, some studies suggest that this instability might be a regulatory feature, ensuring that only correctly spliced mRNAs are stabilized and exported. It could be a quality control mechanism.

**Skeptic:** I see where you're coming from, but it still feels like there's a gap in the logic. If stability is so crucial, why would evolution favor instability in such a critical phase?

**Advocate:** That's a fair question. Perhaps instability ensures that errors are minimized quickly. Any faulty pre-mRNA is rapidly degraded, preventing faulty proteins from being synthesized. The system might prioritize speed over stability in this phase.

**Skeptic:** Alright, but how about empirical evidence? Have there been any direct studies showing this instability?

**Advocate:** Yes, recent experiments using high-throughput sequencing techniques have shown that pre-mRNAs bound to spliceosomal components exhibit faster turnover rates compared to those not bound.

**Skeptic:** Interesting. I suppose that lends some credibility to the claim. Still, more research could solidify this as a widely accepted fact.

**Advocate:** Absolutely, ongoing research will hopefully clarify these mechanisms. But it’s these discussions that drive the scientific process forward, right?

**Skeptic:** Indeed, exploring different angles is what science is all about. Let’s keep probing until we hit the
