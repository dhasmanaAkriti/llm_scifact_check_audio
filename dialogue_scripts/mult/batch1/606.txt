Speaker 1: Alright, so we're looking at the increased conversion of PGE 2 to PPARy ligand 15-ket-PGE 2 causing accumulation of PGE. 

Speaker 2: Right, and that's precisely where the issue lies. The accumulation is creating a metabolic bottleneck. 

Speaker 1: Exactly. But the real threat here is the potential increase in inflammation throughout the system. If we don't address this, it could lead to more severe conditions down the line.

Speaker 2: Agreed. And the cost of not intervening early is significant. We need a strategy that targets the conversion process directly. 

Speaker 1: That's what I was thinking. Perhaps we should consider modifying the enzyme activity. 

Speaker 2: You mean using inhibitors to slow down the conversion rate?

Speaker 1: Exactly. It could help balance the levels of PGE 2 and 15-ket-PGE 2, minimizing the risk of accumulation.

Speaker 2: But here's the catch. If we inhibit too much, we might disrupt other essential pathways. 

Speaker 1: True, and that’s why we need a controlled approach. Maybe a phased implementation could work. 

Speaker 2: Yes, and we should monitor the inflammatory markers closely. That way we can adjust our strategy in real-time.

Speaker 1: So, we're aligned on targeting the conversion process, but with precision to avoid collateral effects?

Speaker 2: Exactly. Let’s draft a proposal that outlines the phased inhibitor approach and includes a detailed monitoring plan.

Speaker 1: Sounds like a plan. Let’s ensure we have a shared understanding with the rest of the team before moving forward.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Let's set up a meeting to discuss this further and get everyone on board. 

Speaker 1: Perfect. I’ll send out the invites. Thanks for the collaboration.

Speaker 2: Anytime. Let’s make sure we address this threat strategically.
