Dr. Lewis: So, Dr. Chen, I understand you're considering integrating oncolytic virus therapy in your upcoming trials. Exciting prospect, isn't it?

Dr. Chen: It is, Dr. Lewis. The potential to selectively target cancer cells is promising. But I've come across claims suggesting that the expression of oncolytic virus antigens as peptides might actually increase the likelihood of relapse. 

Dr. Lewis: Yes, I've heard that argument. It's a compelling point of debate in our field. The concern is that these peptides might trigger an immune response that inadvertently aids tumor regrowth.

Dr. Chen: Exactly. But how solid is this claim? We need to be sure before making any strategic decisions. 

Dr. Lewis: Well, the data isn't entirely conclusive. Some studies suggest the immune response could indeed be a double-edged sword. However, there are strategies to mitigate this, such as combining the virus therapy with immunosuppressive agents or checkpoint inhibitors.

Dr. Chen: That makes sense. But doesn't that add another layer of complexity to the treatment protocol?

Dr. Lewis: It does, but it can also enhance efficacy. The opportunity here is to refine our approach, optimizing the balance between viral oncolysis and immune modulation. 

Dr. Chen: I see. So, we're not dismissing the therapy but rather adapting it to maximize benefits and minimize risks.

Dr. Lewis: Precisely. It's about empowering ourselves with the right data and making informed decisions. We have to push the boundaries of our understanding to really innovate.

Dr. Chen: Thank you, Dr. Lewis. I feel more equipped to make a decision now. I'll delve deeper into the literature and perhaps consult with our immunology team before proceeding.

Dr. Lewis: Absolutely. This is cutting-edge science, Dr. Chen. Keep pushing forward, and you'll find the right path.

Dr. Chen: Will do. Thanks for the discussion. It's invaluable to have a clear perspective.
