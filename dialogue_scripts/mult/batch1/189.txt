 Scientific claim: Broadly HIV-1 Neutralizing Antibodies (bnAb) 10EB have no affinity for phospholipids. 
 Participant Dynamics: Originator vs. Interpreter 
 Contextual Arena: The Personal Arena (goal: to resolve a personal, high-stakes matter) 
 Interaction Trigger: A Recent Discovery (new, urgent data) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Achieve Alignment (find a shared understanding) 
```
Originator: So, Dr. Lewis, you've seen the recent data on the 10EB antibodies?

Interpreter: Indeed, I have. It's quite a revelation, isn't it? No affinity for phospholipids at all.

Originator: Exactly. This changes our entire understanding of how bnAbs function in the presence of viral membranes.

Interpreter: It's surprising, to say the least. We've always thought phospholipids played a pivotal role in antibody interaction.

Originator: Right, and that's precisely why this is so urgent. We need to reconcile this with our current models.

Interpreter: I agree. But, I must ask, are we jumping to conclusions too quickly? Could there be an error in the methodology?

Originator: We were meticulous in our approach. Triple-checked everything. The data is sound.

Interpreter: If that's the case, then we might need to revise some of our foundational theories. This isn't just a minor tweak.

Originator: Precisely. This could redefine how we approach vaccine design. Imagine the possibilities if we can leverage this new insight.

Interpreter: True, but we must ensure the community is on board. Such a fundamental shift requires consensus.

Originator: Of course. That’s why I wanted to discuss this with you first. We need a unified front when presenting this.

Interpreter: Agreed. We should prepare a detailed presentation, addressing potential skepticism head-on.

Originator: Good idea. And maybe we could conduct a few more independent studies to bolster our findings?

Interpreter: Absolutely. The more robust the evidence, the easier it will be to persuade others.

Originator: So, we’re aligned then? On the same page moving forward?

Interpreter: Yes, I believe so. Let’s collaborate closely and make sure we’re thorough. This is too important to mishandle.

Originator: Agreed. Let’s get to work.
