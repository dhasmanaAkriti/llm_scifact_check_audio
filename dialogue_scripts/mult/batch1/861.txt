Dr. Cooper: So, let me get this straight, Lisa. You're saying that the presence of TNF is crucial for granuloma formation in zebrafish?

Lisa: Yes, exactly. It's a key factor in the immune response, as supported by our latest data.

Dr. Cooper: But here's where I'm confused. Last year, you presented findings suggesting granulomas could form independently of TNF, right?

Lisa: That's the point of contention, Dr. Cooper. Those results were preliminary and lacked the robust controls we now have.

Dr. Cooper: Preliminary or not, it was quite a statement that got the community talking. Has your stance shifted entirely?

Lisa: Not entirely, but the new data provide a clearer picture. When TNF is absent, granulomas are poorly formed or absent, which aligns with other studies.

Dr. Cooper: But isn't it possible that other cytokines might compensate in its absence, leading to the formation you observed?

Lisa: That's a valid hypothesis. However, we've controlled for other cytokines this time, and the results consistently point to TNF as indispensable.

Dr. Cooper: I see. So, you're saying the methodology improvements have changed the narrative?

Lisa: Precisely. It's not a contradiction but an evolution of our understanding.

Dr. Cooper: Interesting. I suppose the disagreement lies in the interpretation of your earlier data versus now.

Lisa: Exactly. And I'm here to clarify that to ensure our findings are accurately represented.

Dr. Cooper: Fair enough. I appreciate the clarification, Lisa. Science thrives on such discourse.

Lisa: Thank you, Dr. Cooper. It's crucial we get this right, not just for our team's credibility but for the field as a whole.

Dr. Cooper: Agreed. Let's ensure the next steps involve a broader peer review to solidify these findings.

Lisa: Absolutely. I'm on board with that.

Dr. Cooper: Good. Let's keep the lines of communication open, then.

Lisa: Will do. Thank you for your guidance.
