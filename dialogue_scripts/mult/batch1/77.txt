Dr. Carter: I've just received the preliminary results from the lab, and they suggest that active Ly49Q prevents neutrophil polarization.

Dr. Singh: This is quite a revelation, Dr. Carter. But are we certain about the implications? Neutrophil polarization is crucial in inflammatory responses.

Dr. Carter: I understand your concerns, but this data could shift our understanding entirely. We need to decide if we should halt the current trial to reassess our approach.

Dr. Singh: Halting the trial would have significant consequences. Patients are already seeing benefits from our current regimen. Are these results conclusive enough to justify such a drastic step?

Dr. Carter: Well, the data is robust. The inhibition of neutrophil polarization could mean fewer autoimmune flare-ups. It's a potential game-changer for patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.

Dr. Singh: Yes, but we must weigh that against the potential delay in treatment for those relying on our current protocol. Have you considered what this means for our research timeline?

Dr. Carter: We could fast-track a small cohort study to verify these findings within weeks. If active Ly49Q truly alters neutrophil behavior, it could revolutionize our treatment strategies.

Dr. Singh: Dr. Carter, I value your enthusiasm and the potential of this discovery, but we must proceed cautiously. If we pause the trial and the findings don't hold up...

Dr. Carter: I get it, Dr. Singh. But imagine the impact if we're correct. I propose we convene with the board to present the data and outline a contingency plan.

Dr. Singh: That's reasonable. We need a detailed proposal that addresses both potential and risk. Let's aim to meet with the board by the end of the week.

Dr. Carter: Agreed. I'll prepare the necessary documents and data for the presentation. Thank you for considering this, Dr. Singh.

Dr. Singh: Of course, Dr. Carter. We're in this together, after all. Let's ensure we make the best decision for our patients.
