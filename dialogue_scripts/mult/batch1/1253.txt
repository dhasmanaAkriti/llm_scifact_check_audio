**Dr. Patel**: Good afternoon, Dr. Chen. With the recent mandate from the Department of Health prioritizing research on gene expression, we need to discuss the localization of Linc00173 in mononuclear macrophage nuclei. 

**Dr. Chen**: Afternoon, Dr. Patel. Yes, I've read the latest reports. So, you're suggesting we focus our research on this claim?

**Dr. Patel**: Precisely. The predominant localization of Linc00173 in these nuclei could have significant implications for immunological research. 

**Dr. Chen**: Interesting. But, considering our current projects, do we have the resources to shift focus? 

**Dr. Patel**: That's the crux of it. We need to decide if integrating this focus aligns with our capabilities and goals. The directive is clear, but we have some leeway on execution.

**Dr. Chen**: Well, I understand the potential impact. However, the evidence supporting this localization is still emerging. How conclusive are the findings?

**Dr. Patel**: The data is promising, but you're right; it's not definitive. Yet, the external mandate prioritizes innovative directions like this.

**Dr. Chen**: True. If we proceed, how do you propose we structure our study to validate this claim effectively?

**Dr. Patel**: I suggest a phased approach. Start with in-vitro analyses to confirm localization, then proceed to functional assays. We can collaborate with Dr. Nguyen's lab; they have the necessary imaging technology.

**Dr. Chen**: That makes sense. If we can secure collaboration and reallocate some resources, it might be feasible. But what about our ongoing projects?

**Dr. Patel**: We might need to streamline some of them. The key is to balance compliance with the mandate and our long-term objectives.

**Dr. Chen**: Agreed. Let’s draft a proposal to outline our approach and present it to the committee. If they approve, we can move forward without compromising our existing work.

**Dr. Patel**: Perfect. Let's finalize this plan by the end of the week and seek their feedback. 

**Dr. Chen**: Sounds like a
