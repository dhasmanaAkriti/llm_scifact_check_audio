Dr. Collins: Good morning, Dr. Martinez. I understand there are concerns about the new stem cell approach we're exploring.

Dr. Martinez: Good morning, indeed. Yes, the board is anxious about the potential risks involved. They want to understand why we’re considering autologous transplantation of mesenchymal stem cells over established induction therapies.

Dr. Collins: I see. The primary reason is the promising data showing better graft function. This method appears to reduce rejection rates more effectively than anti-interleukin-2 receptor antibodies.

Dr. Martinez: But isn't there a threat of complication with stem cell procedures? They’re worried about unforeseen immunological reactions.

Dr. Collins: That's a valid concern. However, because we use the patient's own cells, the likelihood of severe immune responses is significantly minimized. The initial trials have indicated a favorable safety profile.

Dr. Martinez: Yet, the cost is another factor. Stem cell treatments are notoriously expensive, and funding is tight.

Dr. Collins: True, but we must weigh that against long-term benefits. Better graft function means fewer complications, potentially reducing overall healthcare costs in the long run.

Dr. Martinez: The board needs reassurance. They want to ensure our approach aligns with both safety and financial prudence.

Dr. Collins: Understood. What if we propose a phased trial? We could start with a smaller cohort, monitor outcomes closely, and scale up based on results. This would mitigate financial risk and provide solid data on efficacy and safety.

Dr. Martinez: That sounds like a prudent plan. I'll present this strategy to the board. We need their backing to proceed.

Dr. Collins: Excellent. Our goal is the same—improved patient outcomes. With alignment, we can achieve groundbreaking results.

Dr. Martinez: Agreed. Let's move forward with caution and confidence. Thank you, Dr. Collins.

Dr. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Martinez. Together, we'll make this work.
