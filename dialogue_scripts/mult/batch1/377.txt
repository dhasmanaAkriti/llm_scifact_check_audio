Dr. Keller: Good afternoon, Dr. Mason. As you know, the new pharmaceutical regulations require us to reassess the efficacy of our compounds. This brings us to emodin and its interaction with PGAM1.

Dr. Mason: Yes, I'm aware. The claim is that emodin forms hydrogen bonds with residues involved in PGAM1 substrate binding. But the implications of this are still under debate. 

Dr. Keller: Precisely. The board needs us to decide whether to pursue emodin as a potential therapeutic agent. Our funding is contingent on this decision.

Dr. Mason: I understand the urgency. However, the evidence for emodin's binding is primarily computational. We need empirical data to support strategic investment.

Dr. Keller: That's a valid point, but the computational data is promising. The model shows strong interactions that could inhibit PGAM1's activity, potentially slowing cancer metabolism. We can't afford to ignore that.

Dr. Mason: True, but the new policy mandates rigorous proof before resource allocation. We should perhaps conduct binding assays to substantiate these interactions.

Dr. Keller: Conducting assays is time-consuming, and there's pressure to make a swift decision. Could we proceed with a parallel approach—initiate preliminary trials while gathering more data?

Dr. Mason: That's risky, Dr. Keller. If the trials don't confirm the computational predictions, we might face setbacks.

Dr. Keller: Risk is inherent in innovation. However, the potential benefits could outweigh the risks. Emodin could be a breakthrough.

Dr. Mason: I see your point. If we proceed, we must ensure robust monitoring and be prepared to pivot based on early results. Are you prepared for that?

Dr. Keller: Absolutely. Let's draft a proposal for the board that outlines this dual-path strategy. We need their approval to move forward.

Dr. Mason: Agreed. I'll prepare the data we have and draft the necessary documentation. Let's aim to have this ready by the end of the week.

Dr. Keller: Excellent. Together, we'll make a well-informed decision. Thank you, Dr. Mason.

Dr. Mason: My pleasure. Let's make it happen.
