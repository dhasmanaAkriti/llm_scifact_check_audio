Practitioner: So, Tirasemtiv targets fast-twitch muscle fibers. This could be a game-changer for patients with muscle weakness.

Decision-Maker: Yes, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. What about the potential risks? I've heard there are concerns about cardiac strain.

Practitioner: Absolutely, and that's why we're here. The fast-twitch focus is promising for enhancing muscle strength, but we need to consider all variables, including cardiovascular impact.

Decision-Maker: Right, and the last thing we want is to introduce a solution that causes another problem. How significant is the cardiac risk?

Practitioner: Current data suggests the risk is manageable with proper monitoring. But, it's crucial we establish a robust protocol to mitigate this.

Decision-Maker: Have we looked into long-term studies on this? I don't want us to be caught off guard down the line.

Practitioner: Long-term effects are still under investigation. However, preliminary results are promising, showing potential improvement in muscle function without severe side effects.

Decision-Maker: Preliminary is good, but we need more. What about patient selection criteria? Can we tailor Tirasemtiv applications to minimize risks?

Practitioner: That's a solid point. Customizing treatment to target only suitable candidates is key. Stratifying patients based on their cardiac profiles could be an effective strategy.

Decision-Maker: And how does this impact our timeline? Are we delaying implementation for further research, or can we proceed with a pilot?

Practitioner: I recommend proceeding with a small-scale pilot while continuing parallel research. This way, we balance innovation with caution.

Decision-Maker: Alright, let's move forward with caution. Prepare the pilot proposal, but ensure we have contingency plans in place for any adverse outcomes.

Practitioner: Understood. I'll work on the proposal and ensure all safety measures are prioritized.

Decision-Maker: Good. Let's aim to make this a breakthrough rather than a liability.

Practitioner: Agreed. I'll keep you updated on our progress.
