Originator: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we need to delve into the claim that cost-effectiveness evaluations based on cRCT data lack external validity. This is crucial as we explore new avenues for our research funding.

Interpreter: Afternoon. So, you're saying these evaluations might not apply well outside their specific study settings?

Originator: Exactly. While cRCTs, or cluster randomised controlled trials, provide robust internal validity, they often fall short when generalized to broader populations.

Interpreter: Ah, I see. So, the potential gain here is to refine our approach to ensure our findings are applicable in real-world settings?

Originator: Precisely. If we can address this gap, our research not only becomes more impactful but also more attractive to funding bodies looking for practical applications.

Interpreter: Makes sense. But how do we tackle this issue? Do we need to adjust our methodologies or perhaps incorporate additional data sources?

Originator: Both, potentially. We could start by integrating observational studies to complement our cRCT data. This would enhance external validity by reflecting real-world populations better.

Interpreter: That sounds viable. But wouldn’t this require additional resources and expertise?

Originator: It might, but the investment could significantly enhance our research credibility. Plus, it opens doors for collaboration with experts in observational studies.

Interpreter: True. And if we pursue this, it empowers us to make more informed and confident decisions on our research direction.

Originator: Exactly. The goal is to inform and empower not just us, but the stakeholders who rely on our findings for policy-making and implementation.

Interpreter: I understand now. It’s about making our research not just theoretically sound but practically useful. Let’s explore this further and see how we can integrate these changes effectively.

Originator: Great. I’m confident that with the right approach, we can achieve significant breakthroughs. Let’s reconvene next week with some proposals on how we can move forward.

Interpreter: Agreed. I’ll start gathering some initial thoughts and data to support this.

Originator: Excellent. Looking forward to it.
