Dr. Collins: So, I've been reviewing the recent studies, and it seems the incidence of 10/66 dementia is higher than the incidence of DSM-IV dementia. 

Dr. Patel: Really? That's quite concerning. I mean, if that's true, it could significantly impact how we approach diagnosis and resource allocation.

Dr. Collins: Exactly. The implications are vast. We could be underestimating the true prevalence of dementia globally.

Dr. Patel: But why the discrepancy between the two diagnostic criteria? Shouldn't they be aligning more closely?

Dr. Collins: Well, the 10/66 criteria account for cultural and environmental factors that the DSM-IV might overlook. It's designed for use in low and middle-income countries, offering a broader perspective.

Dr. Patel: Ah, I see. But if these regions are underdiagnosed, doesn't that pose a threat to their healthcare systems? Resources might be even more strained than we thought.

Dr. Collins: Precisely. That’s why understanding and aligning our diagnostic criteria is crucial. We can’t afford to be complacent in our current practices.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. So, how do we proceed? Is the idea to integrate elements of 10/66 into our existing frameworks?

Dr. Collins: That seems like a logical step. A hybrid approach might give us a more accurate picture. But we need more data... more collaboration between international research teams.

Dr. Patel: Maybe we should organize a symposium to discuss this. Bring together experts from different regions to brainstorm and develop a unified strategy.

Dr. Collins: Great idea. We need alignment not just in understanding, but also in our actions. Let’s ensure every patient, no matter where they are, gets the diagnosis and care they deserve.

Dr. Patel: Yes, let’s make it happen. The cost of inaction is just too high.
