Advocate: So, during our last seminar, the discussion on Notch signaling came up. I mentioned that Notch signaling occurs between tumor cells and stromal cells, and there seemed to be a bit of confusion. 

Skeptic: Right, I remember that. I have to admit, I've read papers suggesting that Notch signaling is primarily intrinsic to tumor cells. How does it extend beyond that?

Advocate: That's a common point of confusion. Recent studies have shown that Notch signaling isn't just an internal mechanism. It's actually a form of communication between tumor cells and their surrounding stromal cells. This interaction is crucial for tumor growth and progression.

Skeptic: But if it's so crucial, how come the primary focus has always been on tumor cells alone?

Advocate: Well, historically, the focus was indeed internal, but as our understanding of the microenvironment grows, so does our knowledge of these interactions. The stromal cells, through Notch signaling, influence tumor behavior by modifying the niche in which the tumor cells thrive.

Skeptic: I see. But what about evidence? How do we know this signaling isn't a secondary effect rather than a direct communication line?

Advocate: Excellent question. Consider the recent experiments that demonstrate changes in stromal cell behavior when Notch signaling is inhibited. The effects are direct, not secondary. These findings suggest a line of communication that’s more than just coincidental.

Skeptic: So, what’s the implication here? Should we be considering therapies targeting the stroma, not just the tumor?

Advocate: Precisely. The decision we need to make is whether to broaden our research focus. If we target both tumor and stromal cells, we might develop more effective therapeutic strategies.

Skeptic: Alright, I see your point. Perhaps it's time to revise our research priorities and consider the potential of targeting stromal cells in our future studies.

Advocate: Agreed. It seems we’re on the same page now. Let's plan to dive deeper into this in our next project meeting.

Skeptic: Sounds like a plan.
