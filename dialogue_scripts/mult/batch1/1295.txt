Dr. Reynolds: Good afternoon, Emily. I understand you have some concerns about Erythromycin and its effects on your newborn.

Emily: Yes, Dr. Reynolds. I read somewhere that using Erythromycin can lead to hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in infants. My son was prescribed it last week, and I’m really worried.

Dr. Reynolds: That’s understandable, Emily. The claim that Erythromycin causes hypertrophic pyloric stenosis has been thoroughly examined in multiple studies. The consensus in the scientific community is that there is no direct relation.

Emily: But what about those studies that suggest a link? I’m just trying to make sure I’m not putting my son at risk.

Dr. Reynolds: I appreciate your concern. Some studies in the past did raise alarms, but they were found to have methodological flaws. More recent, comprehensive research has shown no significant correlation. We have very robust data supporting this.

Emily: So, you're saying it’s safe for my child to continue this medication without worrying about such side effects?

Dr. Reynolds: Yes, the benefits of the medication in treating your son's condition outweigh the potential risks. The cases where adverse effects were noted involved different circumstances. 

Emily: But what if there’s a chance? Even a small one? I can’t shake the feeling... what if my son becomes one of those cases?

Dr. Reynolds: I understand. Medicine always involves weighing risks and benefits. I assure you, if there was credible evidence linking Erythromycin use to hypertrophic pyloric stenosis in your son’s case, we would explore alternative treatments.

Emily: I suppose that makes sense. I just needed to hear it directly from you.

Dr. Reynolds: Of course. Always feel free to ask questions. Your child’s health is our priority, and I’m here to support you every step of the way.

Emily: Thank you, Dr. Reynolds. I feel more at ease now.

Dr. Reynolds: You’re welcome, Emily. Anytime you have concerns, don’t hesitate to reach out.
