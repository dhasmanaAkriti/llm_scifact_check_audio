**Speaker 1: So, as many of you know, a new policy has been introduced stating that Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, or CBT, is no longer recommended for treating insomnia. The claim is that it's ineffective.**

**Speaker 2: That’s a bold statement. I'm curious about the evidence behind this policy shift. What makes CBT suddenly ineffective?**

**Speaker 1: Well, the policy was influenced by recent studies suggesting that CBT doesn't significantly improve sleep patterns compared to other treatments, like medication.**

**Speaker 2: I’ve read those studies, and while they do highlight some limitations, they also recognize CBT's long-term benefits without the side effects of medication. Aren’t we overlooking the broader picture?**

**Speaker 1: True, but the immediate results are often prioritized. People want quick fixes, and medications seem to offer that. CBT requires time and commitment, which not everyone is willing to invest.**

**Speaker 2: But isn't the goal of treatment to achieve sustainable, healthy sleep patterns, not just temporary relief? CBT targets the root of insomnia by addressing the thoughts and behaviors that contribute to it.**

**Speaker 1: I agree, but the mandate focuses on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Medications are cheaper and act faster, which is appealing to policymakers.**

**Speaker 2: That’s a short-sighted approach. By only considering upfront costs and immediate outcomes, we risk ignoring the long-term health benefits of CBT. Plus, medications can lead to dependency and other health issues.**

**Speaker 1: Interesting point. So, you believe the policy overlooks the real value of CBT?**

**Speaker 2: Absolutely. We need to expose the flaw that not all improvements are immediately visible. Long-term health should be our priority.**

**Speaker 1: Perhaps there's room to re-evaluate the policy, considering both short-term and long-term outcomes.**

**Speaker 2: Exactly. Let’s aim for a balanced approach that acknowledges the proven benefits of CBT alongside other treatments.**

**Speaker 1: I see your point. This conversation might just be a catalyst for change.**

**Speaker 2: I hope so. It's crucial we don't dismiss
