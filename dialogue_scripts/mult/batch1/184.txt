Originator: So, as we dive into this research proposal, the key finding we're working with is that bone marrow cells don't contribute to adult macrophage compartments. This changes our approach fundamentally.

Interpreter: Right, but that finding seems counterintuitive. We've operated under the assumption that bone marrow is a primary source for macrophages in adults.

Originator: I understand the confusion. It's a significant shift, indeed. The latest studies, however, show that adult macrophages are maintained in tissues without any contribution from circulating bone marrow-derived cells.

Interpreter: But how do we reconcile this with existing literature that suggests otherwise? There's a substantial body of work supporting the contribution of bone marrow.

Originator: That's precisely the point of contention. Much of that past research didn't differentiate between transient and resident macrophages. Recent techniques have allowed us to see that resident macrophages, those that serve crucial roles in tissue maintenance, actually self-renew locally.

Interpreter: Interesting. So, are you suggesting we pivot and focus our proposal on the mechanisms of local self-renewal instead?

Originator: Exactly. By exploring this new avenue, we can be at the forefront of redefining macrophage biology. It’s a strategic move that could yield significant insights.

Interpreter: But won't this shift require us to overhaul our current methodologies and collaborations?

Originator: Yes, it will. But the potential payoff in terms of novel therapeutic targets is worth the investment. We need to decide if we're ready to commit to this path.

Interpreter: Given the compelling new data, I agree. Let's proceed with the pivot. We should update our collaborators and align our resources accordingly.

Originator: Great. I'll draft the revised proposal and coordinate a meeting to discuss next steps.

Interpreter: Sounds good. Let's ensure our data is robust and ready for scrutiny. We’re venturing into uncharted territory.

Originator: Absolutely. It’s both challenging and exciting. Let’s make it count.
