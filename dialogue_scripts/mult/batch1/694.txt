Dr. Harris: Good afternoon, Dr. Lin. I understand the new health policy mandates a deeper dive into vaccine efficacy, particularly the SIV vaccines. 

Dr. Lin: Yes, indeed. The mandate emphasizes the importance of understanding immune responses, especially with claims like "Lice attenuated SIV vaccines induce a stronger antigen-specific T cell response in lymph node cells."

Dr. Harris: Quite a mouthful, isn't it? So, how do we approach this? 

Dr. Lin: Well, I think we should start by exploring the claim's implications. The idea is that these vaccines might enhance the immune response more effectively than traditional methods.

Dr. Harris: Right, but why lice? It seems counterintuitive. 

Dr. Lin: The hypothesis is that lice attenuated vaccines may mimic a more natural infection process, potentially priming the immune system better. 

Dr. Harris: And this stronger T cell response, specifically in lymph nodes, what could that mean for broader vaccine development?

Dr. Lin: If verified, it could revolutionize how we design vaccines for other viral infections, not just SIV. We need a robust mechanism to test this claim. 

Dr. Harris: Agreed. We should collaborate with immunologists to design experiments that measure T cell responses in detail. 

Dr. Lin: Absolutely, and perhaps partner with a lab specializing in lymphatic studies. This could give us a comprehensive view.

Dr. Harris: So, to achieve alignment here, we're looking at a multi-disciplinary approach. Immunology, virology, and lymphatic systems must be part of our exploratory framework.

Dr. Lin: Precisely. By aligning our expertise, we can assess the validity of the lice attenuated vaccine claim and its potential impact on future policies.

Dr. Harris: Perfect. Let's draft a proposal to present at the next policy review meeting. We'll need to ensure everyone understands the scientific basis and potential benefits. 

Dr. Lin: I'll get started on that right away. It seems we’re on the same page. 

Dr. Harris: Indeed. Thanks, Dr. Lin. Let's keep the momentum going.
