Dr. Lewis: Alright, Dr. Patel, we've all seen the data you presented on the PRDM1 gene. You claim it's central to the formation of primordial germ cells, but isn't that a bit of a stretch?

Dr. Patel: Good morning, Dr. Lewis. I understand your skepticism. However, the evidence is quite compelling. The research shows that without PRDM1, these cells simply don't develop.

Dr. Lewis: Yes, but we're talking about basing an entire funding proposal on this. If PRDM1 isn't as crucial as you say, we could be funneling resources into a dead end.

Dr. Patel: I see your point. But, the risk is worth the potential rewards. Our understanding of germ cell development hinges on this. Imagine the implications for fertility treatments alone.

Dr. Lewis: But what about the studies that point to other genes playing a similar role? If we're wrong, it could undermine the credibility of our entire project.

Dr. Patel: True, but those studies don't negate the role of PRDM1. They complement it. We can't ignore that it's been consistently highlighted across various models.

Dr. Lewis: You're asking us to put a lot on the line here. We need more than just consistent highlighting. We need undeniable evidence.

Dr. Patel: And that's precisely what this proposal seeks to achieve. By focusing on PRDM1, we can validate or refute its role definitively. We need to be strategic in our approach.

Dr. Lewis: I do see the strategic potential, but we need alignment on this. Can we agree on a phased approach? Start with a preliminary study to gather more data before fully committing?

Dr. Patel: That sounds reasonable. Let's ensure the initial phase is robust enough to inform our next steps. Can we align on that?

Dr. Lewis: Yes, I think that's a sensible compromise. Let's draft the proposal with that phased approach in mind.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's turn this potential threat into an opportunity for groundbreaking discovery.
