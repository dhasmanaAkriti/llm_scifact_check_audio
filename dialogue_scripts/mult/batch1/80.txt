Dr. Patel: Alright, team, before we proceed with the CRISPR experiments, we need to address the recent findings on KRAS ablation. If the claim that "Acute ablation of KRAS causes severe growth impairment" holds, this could be problematic.

Dr. Lee: Right, Patel. The data from the latest study is compelling, but we need to consider whether this presents a significant risk to our current research trajectory.

Dr. Patel: Exactly. If the growth impairment is as severe as suggested, it could jeopardize our entire study. Our focus has been on introducing KRAS knockouts to observe oncogene addiction in tumor cells.

Dr. Lee: True, but we also have to weigh the potential benefits. If we can mitigate the impairment, the insights could be groundbreaking. I'm not ready to abandon ship just yet.

Dr. Patel: I agree, Lee. But we need a contingency plan. How do we address the impairment without compromising the integrity of our results?

Dr. Lee: We could consider a phased approach. Start with partial ablation to see if there's a threshold where the impairment isn't as pronounced. It might give us a window to gather preliminary data.

Dr. Patel: That's a viable option. However, how do we ensure the initial results aren't skewed by incomplete ablation? We need robust controls in place.

Dr. Lee: We can use a control group with a known oncogenic driver, not reliant on KRAS, to monitor any aberrant growth patterns. It’ll help us differentiate between the ablation effects and other variables.

Dr. Patel: Alright, let's proceed with caution. We initiate with partial ablation, keeping an eye on growth metrics. If signs of severe impairment appear, we halt and reassess.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. We'll need to maintain clear communication and document every step meticulously. Let's finalize the protocol and inform the team.

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. Let's ensure we're prepared for any outcome. Meeting adjourned.
