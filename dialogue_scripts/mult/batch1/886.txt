Dr. Miller: Good afternoon, Dr. Hayes. I've been reviewing the latest statistics on surgical trials, and an alarming claim caught my attention: "One in two surgical randomized controlled trials are discontinued early."

Dr. Hayes: Ah, yes, I've seen that report. It's a significant concern within our field. The implications are quite serious for both research integrity and patient outcomes.

Dr. Miller: Exactly. The threat of these discontinuations could undermine public trust in medical research. Patients might hesitate to participate if they believe their involvement might be cut short without conclusive results.

Dr. Hayes: That is a valid point. But it's important to understand the reasons behind these discontinuations. Often, it's due to funding issues, recruitment challenges, or ethical concerns when preliminary results indicate harm.

Dr. Miller: I understand there are valid reasons, but shouldn't we aim for more stringent protocols from the outset? Perhaps through better feasibility studies or improved funding strategies?

Dr. Hayes: Absolutely, improved planning could prevent some of these issues. However, we must also balance this against the need to start trials in a timely manner to address urgent medical questions.

Dr. Miller: True, but surely there's a middle ground. Maybe we could engage more multidisciplinary teams early in the trial design to foresee potential roadblocks?

Dr. Hayes: That's a constructive approach. Involving statisticians, ethicists, and patient representatives early could definitely enhance trial robustness and sustainability.

Dr. Miller: So, can we agree that our next steps should focus on advocating for these changes at our upcoming conference?

Dr. Hayes: Yes, aligning on this issue is crucial. We need to push for systematic changes to ensure that trials are not just initiated, but completed successfully. Let's draft a proposal together.

Dr. Miller: Sounds like a plan. Let's set a meeting to discuss the specifics. Thank you for your insights, Dr. Hayes.

Dr. Hayes: Thank you, Dr. Miller. I'm glad we're on the same page.
