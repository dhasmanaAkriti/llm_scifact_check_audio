**Dr. Elaine Carter (Advocate):** Now, the traditional understanding has been that pyridostatin is just a G-quadruplex stabilizer. But, evidence is emerging that pyridostatin induces checkpoint activation, which could be crucial in cancer therapy.

**Dr. Mike Thompson (Skeptic):** Elaine, I've heard about this claim. But isn't it a bit premature to say it induces checkpoint activation? We're talking about a potential risk of overactivating cellular mechanisms here.

**Dr. Carter:** I understand the concern, Mike, but the data doesn't lie. Trials have shown a significant increase in checkpoint proteins when pyridostatin is introduced.

**Dr. Thompson:** Are we sure these trials account for all variables? Overactivation could lead to catastrophic outcomes like cellular apoptosis or even necrosis. Have they ruled out these risks?

**Dr. Carter:** The preliminary trials have been quite thorough. The checkpoints were activated without indications of adverse events. It seems targeted enough to avoid widespread cellular damage.

**Dr. Thompson:** But Elaine, targeted therapies often have unforeseen consequences. Remember the issue with early kinase inhibitors? We need to be cautious about claiming checkpoint activation without understanding the full mechanism.

**Dr. Carter:** You're right about needing more data. But isn't it worth exploring further? Imagine the potential if pyridostatin can selectively activate checkpoints in cancer cells.

**Dr. Thompson:** Absolutely, I'm not against exploration. But what if this activation isn't as selective as we hope? We could induce severe immune responses or secondary malignancies.

**Dr. Carter:** True, that's a valid threat. Perhaps we need to design experiments specifically to test these scenarios. It's clear we need more robust data before making any definitive claims.

**Dr. Thompson:** Yes, Elaine, that's the prudent approach. I respect the potential here, but we must tread carefully. Science demands it.

**Dr. Carter:** Agreed, let's push forward, but with caution. We have a duty to ensure safety alongside innovation.

**Dr. Thompson:** Absolutely. Let's reconvene with some more focused studies. Together, we might uncover something groundbreaking.
