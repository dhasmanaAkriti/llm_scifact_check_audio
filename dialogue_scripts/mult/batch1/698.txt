Dr. Carter: Good afternoon, Ms. Perez. I understand there's a new directive advocating for the use of Lmna knock-in models in HGPS research. 

Ms. Perez: Yes, Dr. Carter. As the beneficiary of this research, I'm keen to understand how this will impact the development of therapies.

Dr. Carter: Certainly. The recent policy emphasizes Lmna knock-in models because they closely mimic the pathogenesis of HGPS, thus providing a more accurate testing ground for potential treatments.

Ms. Perez: I see. But why this sudden shift? What makes these models superior to others we've used?

Dr. Carter: Well, the external mandate was influenced by recent studies showing that these models exhibit similar phenotypic traits to human HGPS. Their genetic fidelity allows for a more precise evaluation of therapeutic efficacy.

Ms. Perez: That sounds promising. However, how does this align with our current strategic goals? Are we ready to pivot our research efforts?

Dr. Carter: It's a strategic choice, certainly. The alignment will require reallocation of resources and maybe some realignment of ongoing projects. But the scientific consensus is that this approach will significantly enhance our understanding and treatment of the syndrome.

Ms. Perez: It's crucial that we achieve consensus among all stakeholders. Parents and patients need assurance that this is the right path forward.

Dr. Carter: Absolutely. Our goal is to achieve alignment, ensuring that everyone involved understands the potential benefits. Collaborative discussions with patient advocacy groups are already in the pipeline.

Ms. Perez: That's a relief. If this can accelerate the development of effective therapies, I’m all for it. However, transparency throughout this transition is key.

Dr. Carter: Agreed. I’ll ensure that communication remains open and that we keep all parties informed every step of the way. Shall we convene a meeting to discuss this further?

Ms. Perez: Yes, let's do that. I appreciate your willingness to navigate this complex landscape with clarity and collaboration, Dr. Carter.

Dr. Carter: Thank you, Ms. Perez. Together, we can make significant strides in combating HGPS.
