Speaker 1: So, the new research suggests that Piezo1 channels are sensors for cell migration in epithelial cells. 

Speaker 2: Right, but I've read counterarguments. Some researchers claim it's not the channels themselves, but rather the surrounding cellular environment that influences migration.

Speaker 1: I get that, but the external mandate from the university board, pushing for us to integrate these findings into our curriculum, complicates things. They're convinced it's groundbreaking.

Speaker 2: That's exactly the problem. Jumping into integrating these findings without thorough vetting could mislead students. 

Speaker 1: Are you suggesting we disregard the mandate? I mean, the board's expectations are clear, and they're basing their decision on well-funded studies.

Speaker 2: Not disregard, but scrutinize. We've always prided ourselves on teaching evidence-based science. If we rush, what message does that send?

Speaker 1: But this isn't just any trend—it's potentially transformative. If Piezo1 channels truly are sensors, it could redefine our understanding of cell migration.

Speaker 2: True, and I'm not denying that potential. But until there's consensus in the scientific community, we should present it as a developing theory, not a fact.

Speaker 1: So, you think we should frame it as a hypothesis rather than a conclusion in our lectures?

Speaker 2: Precisely. We owe it to our students to emphasize critical thinking, not just absorbing the latest shiny idea.

Speaker 1: I see your point. Balancing innovation with skepticism has always been a challenge for us.

Speaker 2: Exactly. Let's propose a curriculum update that presents both the findings and the ongoing debates. We can shape informed scientists, not just followers.

Speaker 1: Agreed. I'll draft a proposal for the board. Hopefully, they'll appreciate our commitment to rigorous science.

Speaker 2: I think they will. After all, isn't critical examination what science is all about?
