Dr. Lee: So, Alex, I heard you’re diving into the LRRK2 mutations and their impact on axonal transport. How’s that going?

Dr. Alex: Ah, it’s fascinating, really. I’ve been focusing on how increased microtubule acetylation worsens interference caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations. It’s a bit of a puzzle.

Dr. Lee: Right, I read a paper suggesting that connection. But tell me, how does that affect your broader research?

Dr. Alex: Well, it opens up an opportunity to explore potential therapeutic targets. If we can modulate acetylation levels, we might alleviate the transport disruptions in neurons.

Dr. Lee: That’s exciting, Alex. So, what’s your next step?

Dr. Alex: I’m planning to test some HDAC6 inhibitors to see if they can restore normal transport rates. It’d be a game-changer if it works.

Dr. Lee: Definitely. But have you considered the implications for Parkinson's treatments? Given LRRK2’s role there, it could be significant.

Dr. Alex: Absolutely. If we can establish a clear link, it might lead to novel treatment avenues for those suffering from Parkinson’s. The stakes are high, but so is the potential impact.

Dr. Lee: It sounds like you’re on the right track. But how do you plan to communicate these findings to the broader community?

Dr. Alex: I’m thinking of drafting a paper and presenting at the next neuroscience conference. It’s crucial to get feedback and see if others have observed similar phenomena.

Dr. Lee: That’s a solid plan. Remember, empowering others with your insights could lead to collaborative breakthroughs.

Dr. Alex: Thanks, Lee. Your perspective is invaluable. I’ll keep you posted on my progress.

Dr. Lee: I look forward to it, Alex. Let’s make some waves in the field together.

Dr. Alex: Absolutely. Here’s to new discoveries.
