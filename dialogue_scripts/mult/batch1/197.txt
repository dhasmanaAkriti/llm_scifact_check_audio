Dr. Morris: Good morning, everyone. It appears we have a new directive from the funding council. They want us to focus on the CCL19 and CCR7 interaction. 

Dr. Ellis: Yes, I saw the memo. They're quite adamant about this, aren't they? CCL19 as a ligand for CCR7 is a well-accepted notion, but they seem to want a deeper dive. 

Dr. Morris: Precisely. The mandate is to either reinforce or challenge the current understanding. 

Dr. Ellis: Well, CCR7 is crucial in directing immune cell migration, and CCL19 is one of its primary ligands. That’s indisputable, right?

Dr. Morris: That's the textbook view. However, the council's interest suggests they suspect there's more beneath the surface, perhaps nuances we haven't considered.

Dr. Ellis: What could be flawed about the interaction? The binding affinity between CCL19 and CCR7 has been documented extensively.

Dr. Morris: True, but consider that recent studies have hinted at alternative ligands or even competitive inhibitors affecting this pathway. 

Dr. Ellis: Are you suggesting another molecule could mimic CCL19 or even block its pathway with CCR7?

Dr. Morris: It's a possibility worth exploring. If such a molecule exists, it could revolutionize our understanding of immune cell navigation. 

Dr. Ellis: And potentially explain anomalies in immune response patterns. We need to design experiments to test for these alternate interactions.

Dr. Morris: Exactly. We must look at this with fresh eyes, perhaps utilizing emerging technologies or novel computational models.

Dr. Ellis: Agreed. I'll start drafting a proposal for a series of binding assays. Let's see if there's a hidden truth in this assumed certainty.

Dr. Morris: Perfect. Let's ensure our research doesn't just support existing knowledge but challenges it, should the evidence demand it.

Dr. Ellis: This could be groundbreaking. Let's get to work. 

Dr. Morris: Indeed, let's get to it.
