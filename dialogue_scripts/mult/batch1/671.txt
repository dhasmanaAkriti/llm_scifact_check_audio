**Dr. Fielding:** So, Dr. Alvarez, you're saying that knocking out the proximal tubule-specific BMP receptor Alk3 directly causes fibrosis?

**Dr. Alvarez:** Exactly, Dr. Fielding. Our research indicates that the absence of Alk3 leads to fibrotic changes.

**Dr. Fielding:** But isn't the role of Alk3 more related to bone morphogenetic processes rather than fibrosis?

**Dr. Alvarez:** Typically, yes. However, our findings suggest a direct link in renal tissues. It's a novel pathway.

**Dr. Fielding:** Hmm, I'm trying to reconcile this with the established literature. Fibrosis usually involves TGF-beta pathways, not BMP signaling.

**Dr. Alvarez:** Right, and that's where our point of confusion lies. We suspect there might be crosstalk between these signaling pathways that hasn't been fully understood yet.

**Dr. Fielding:** Crosstalk, you say? That would be groundbreaking if true. But how do you differentiate the effects of Alk3 knockout from other compensatory mechanisms?

**Dr. Alvarez:** Good question. We used a conditional knockout model to specifically target proximal tubules, minimizing off-target effects. The fibrosis was pronounced, suggesting a primary role.

**Dr. Fielding:** Still, I wonder if there might be an indirect mechanism at play. Could the knockout be altering cellular environment, triggering fibrotic pathways?

**Dr. Alvarez:** That's exactly why we're diving deeper. We're examining downstream effects to map out any indirect pathways.

**Dr. Fielding:** Intriguing. It seems we need to broaden our scope. Perhaps a collaborative study integrating both BMP and TGF-beta pathways could clarify the mechanisms.

**Dr. Alvarez:** I agree. Mapping out these points of conflict might illuminate the broader picture. Your expertise on TGF-beta would be invaluable.

**Dr. Fielding:** Let's set up a meeting with our teams. If we can define these disagreements, we might just uncover new therapeutic targets.

**Dr. Alvarez:** Absolutely. I'll coordinate with my team to get started.

**Dr. Fielding:** Great, Dr. Alvarez. Let's challenge these assumptions and see where the data leads us.
