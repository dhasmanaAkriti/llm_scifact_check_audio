Dr. Mitchell: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we need to address a crucial finding regarding IL-18. Recent studies suggest that repressing IL-18 has negative effects on atherosclerotic lesion composition and progression.

Dr. Carter: Dr. Mitchell, could you clarify the potential risks involved here? 

Dr. Mitchell: Certainly, Dr. Carter. IL-18 is instrumental in modulating inflammatory responses within lesions. Repressing it may exacerbate plaque instability, increasing the risk of cardiovascular events.

Dr. Carter: But isn't IL-18 suppression supposed to reduce inflammation overall? How does it end up doing more harm?

Dr. Mitchell: It's complicated. While IL-18 suppression reduces some inflammatory markers, it seems to alter the lesion's cellular composition, making them more prone to rupture.

Dr. Carter: This poses a significant threat, doesn't it? If we proceed with therapies that suppress IL-18 without fully understanding these dynamics, we risk worsening the patient's condition.

Dr. Mitchell: Exactly. That's why we must be cautious. The current data suggests that IL-18 plays a dual role, and completely repressing it might not be the ideal therapeutic strategy.

Dr. Carter: So, what are our options moving forward? Do we halt further development of IL-18 inhibitors?

Dr. Mitchell: Not necessarily halt, but we should pivot. We need more research to explore targeted approaches that balance IL-18's pro-inflammatory and protective roles. 

Dr. Carter: Could we consider combination therapies that modulate rather than suppress IL-18?

Dr. Mitchell: That's a viable path. Combining therapies could maintain the protective benefits while minimizing adverse effects. But it requires rigorous testing.

Dr. Carter: I agree. We can't afford to take unnecessary risks. Let's allocate resources to more comprehensive studies before making any decisive moves on IL-18 therapies.

Dr. Mitchell: Agreed. It's imperative we make informed decisions, ensuring patient safety and efficacy in our treatments. Let's reconvene next week with our research teams to outline a new strategy.
