**Dr. Lewis:** So, our hypothesis suggests a breast cancer patient's capacity to metabolize tamoxifen directly influences treatment outcomes. This is a pretty significant claim.

**Dr. Patel:** Right, but I'm a bit puzzled. If metabolism is key, shouldn't we have more consistent results across our patient data? It feels like there's something we're not considering.

**Dr. Lewis:** Well, metabolism is a complex process. It's influenced by genetic factors, liver function, even diet. We're not just looking at a single factor here.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but the variation is still too large. If genetics were the sole player, wouldn't we see more predictability within genetic subgroups?

**Dr. Lewis:** That's exactly the point of confusion we're trying to address. Perhaps there's an interaction effect we're missing, like with concurrent medications or environmental factors?

**Dr. Patel:** Could be. But if that's the case, why haven't we identified a clear pattern in our research? We've accounted for the most common variables already.

**Dr. Lewis:** Good question. Maybe it's the less common variables that are causing the discrepancies. Rare genetic mutations or overlooked lifestyle factors might play a bigger role than we anticipated.

**Dr. Patel:** So, you're suggesting a deeper dive into those rarer variables? That could be a massive undertaking.

**Dr. Lewis:** Yes, but it might be necessary to fully map out the disagreement. It's either that or reconsider our entire hypothesis, which I’m not ready to do without further exploration.

**Dr. Patel:** Fair enough. Let’s focus on gathering more detailed patient histories and see if any patterns emerge. We might uncover hidden factors that could clear up this confusion.

**Dr. Lewis:** Agreed. Let's redefine the parameters of our study to include those potential variables. It’s a challenging path, but one worth taking.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. Science thrives on exploring the unknown, after all. Let's get to it.
