Dr. Patel: So, with the recent policy pushing for more aggressive anti-viral strategies, I've been reviewing the effects of cytidine deamination in viral DNA. Have you heard about this?

Dr. Morales: Yes, I have. You're referring to the claim that it can inactivate viral genomes by causing G-to-A mutations, correct?

Dr. Patel: Exactly. The idea is that by converting cytidine to uridine on the minus strand, it disrupts the genome enough to halt replication.

Dr. Morales: I see. But isn't that a bit speculative? I mean, are we sure these mutations are consistently detrimental to the virus?

Dr. Patel: It's a fair question. The evidence suggests a high rate of error in the replication process post-deamination, which seems to cripple the virus's ability to propagate.

Dr. Morales: But doesn't the viral genome have mechanisms to counteract mutations? I'm skeptical that a single pathway could effectively neutralize it.

Dr. Patel: True, many viruses have robust repair mechanisms. However, in this case, the mutation load appears to overwhelm those defenses. The policy emphasizes exploring new avenues, and this could be a promising one.

Dr. Morales: I'm cautious, though. If we're going to allocate resources to this, we need to be sure it’s not just another dead-end.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely, and that's why we're in this exploratory phase. By understanding the exact conditions under which these mutations occur, we can better assess the strategy's viability.

Dr. Morales: I appreciate your enthusiasm, but we should also consider the possible consequences of inadvertently fostering resistant strains.

Dr. Patel: Definitely, hence why we're proceeding with thorough research. The goal is not just to inform, but to empower us to make an independent decision that aligns with the policy's objectives.

Dr. Morales: Agreed. Let's continue to gather data and revisit this with a broader evidence base. We need to be both informed and cautious.

Dr. Patel: Sounds like a plan. I’ll keep you updated with the latest findings.

Dr. Morales: Looking forward to it.
