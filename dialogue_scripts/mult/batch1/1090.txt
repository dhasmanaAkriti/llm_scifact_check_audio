Dr. Harper: So, Dr. Lewis, with this new mandate from the funding board, we need to decide how to proceed with our research on the Smc5/6 complex’s role in halting the activation of SUMO E3 ligase Mms21.

Dr. Lewis: Right, Dr. Harper. The mandate emphasizes focusing on groundbreaking findings. Our initial data shows that Smc5/6 engagement interferes with Mms21 activation through ATP-dependent remodeling. It’s a substantial claim.

Dr. Harper: Indeed. But the board is pushing for actionable outcomes. How does this claim translate into practical applications?

Dr. Lewis: Well, understanding this mechanism could lead to novel cancer therapeutics. Tumors often hijack the SUMOylation pathway for growth. If we can modulate this interaction, we might control tumor progression.

Dr. Harper: That’s a promising angle. But is the evidence robust enough? The board will want assurance before committing more resources.

Dr. Lewis: Our experiments consistently show that Smc5/6 directly affects Mms21. However, expanding our sample size and exploring additional cell lines would solidify our findings. We’d need more funding for that.

Dr. Harper: So, you're suggesting we request further funding to conduct broader trials?

Dr. Lewis: Precisely. And if we can demonstrate this mechanism’s effect across multiple models, it could significantly bolster our case.

Dr. Harper: Agreed. But we’ll need preliminary results quickly. The board’s patience is finite.

Dr. Lewis: Understood. I can prioritize the experiments and prepare a comprehensive proposal. Engaging our collaborators might also speed up the process.

Dr. Harper: Good. Let’s proceed with your plan. I’ll back your proposal at the next board meeting. But ensure the data is irrefutable.

Dr. Lewis: Absolutely, Dr. Harper. I’ll coordinate with the team and get started immediately.

Dr. Harper: Excellent. Let’s aim to turn this scientific claim into a transformative discovery.
