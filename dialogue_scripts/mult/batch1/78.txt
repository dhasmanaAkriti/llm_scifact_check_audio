Dr. Lee: So, Jane, our preliminary data suggest that active caspase-11 participates in regulating phagosome-lysosome fusion. This could be a breakthrough in understanding cellular processes.

Jane: That's intriguing, Dr. Lee. However, before we jump to conclusions, let's consider the implications. How robust is your evidence?

Dr. Lee: We've repeated the experiments several times with consistent results. The caspase-11 activity correlates with increased fusion events. It's an opportunity to redefine our understanding of immune responses.

Jane: Opportunity or not, we need to be cautious. The existing literature primarily associates caspase-11 with inflammatory responses, not fusion processes.

Dr. Lee: True, but that's precisely why this finding is exciting. It challenges the current model and could open new research avenues.

Jane: But how do you address the potential for confounding variables? What if there's another protein mediating this effect?

Dr. Lee: We've controlled for several known variables, but I acknowledge the complexity. More assays are necessary to rule out indirect interactions.

Jane: And what about funding? Pursuing this line of inquiry will require resources. We need to justify this deviation from our current focus.

Dr. Lee: I believe the potential benefits are worth it. If caspase-11 indeed plays a dual role, it could inform therapeutic strategies for a range of diseases.

Jane: I agree there's potential, but we must be strategic. Perhaps a smaller pilot study to solidify the claim before broadening our scope?

Dr. Lee: That's a reasonable approach. We can draft a proposal for a targeted study, focusing on isolating caspase-11's role in fusion.

Jane: Let's do that. I'll need a detailed plan by next week. Ensure it addresses all potential pitfalls.

Dr. Lee: Absolutely, Jane. I'll get started right away.
