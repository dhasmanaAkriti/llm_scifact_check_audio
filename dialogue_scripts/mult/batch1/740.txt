Dr. Harris: So, Dr. Kim, you're suggesting that MUC1-C activates the NF-κB p65 signaling pathway by interacting with IκB kinase ß. Is that correct?

Dr. Kim: Precisely. Our data indicates a direct interaction that facilitates the pathway's activation. 

Dr. Harris: But this contradicts some of the foundational work we've seen. Aren't these interactions typically mediated through upstream signals like cytokines?

Dr. Kim: That's the traditional understanding, yes. However, our findings suggest a novel mechanism where MUC1-C acts independently of those signals.

Dr. Harris: Interesting, but it raises many questions. For instance, how do you account for the variance in NF-κB activation levels observed in different cell types?

Dr. Kim: That's a valid point. We hypothesize that MUC1-C's expression levels could play a significant role, varying its effect across cell types.

Dr. Harris: I see. But wouldn't that imply a dependency on the cellular environment, contradicting the independent activation claim?

Dr. Kim: Not necessarily. Think of it as MUC1-C providing an alternative route for activation. The environment might influence the degree but not the occurrence of the interaction.

Dr. Harris: So, you're positing that MUC1-C can bypass conventional pathways, acting as a sort of molecular shortcut?

Dr. Kim: Exactly. It's an unconventional path, but consistent with our observations.

Dr. Harris: I appreciate your perspective, but without reconciling these discrepancies with existing literature, acceptance will be challenging.

Dr. Kim: We aim to map out these conflicts through further studies. Clarifying these interactions could redefine how we approach therapeutic targets.

Dr. Harris: Well, it certainly demands more exploration. Let’s strategize on how best to validate these claims robustly.

Dr. Kim: Agreed. Collaboration could be key here, aligning our methodologies to address these critical questions.
