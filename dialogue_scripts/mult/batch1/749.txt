**Dr. Patel**: So, let's dive into this hypothesis about T cell activation. We've long understood that major antigen-induced signals from the T cell receptor are crucial. But now, it seems secondary signals from costimulatory receptors are also required. 

**Dr. Evans**: Absolutely, Dr. Patel. The interplay between these signals is fascinating, but I'm concerned about the potential risks of overlooking any one component. 

**Dr. Patel**: Precisely. If we don't fully understand this dual-signal requirement, we might misinterpret T cell responses in our experiments, leading to flawed conclusions.

**Dr. Evans**: Right. And considering our reliance on these signals for developing immunotherapies, a misstep could delay critical advancements. 

**Dr. Patel**: That's the threat, isn't it? We need to ensure our models reflect the complexity of these interactions. Let's brainstorm how we might achieve a more comprehensive understanding.

**Dr. Evans**: Perhaps we should integrate a broader range of signaling pathways in our studies. Have we considered using advanced imaging techniques to visualize these interactions in real-time?

**Dr. Patel**: Excellent suggestion. Real-time visualization could reveal dynamic changes that static models miss. But how do we ensure the accuracy of these observations?

**Dr. Evans**: Well, perhaps by cross-referencing our findings with in vivo experiments. If we can validate our observations in a living system, it might strengthen our understanding.

**Dr. Patel**: Agreed. Alignment between in vitro and in vivo results would be ideal. We should also involve computational modeling to simulate these interactions, providing a predictive framework.

**Dr. Evans**: Yes, that could help anticipate potential pitfalls in therapy development. Let's make this a priority in our next research phase, ensuring our approach is holistic.

**Dr. Patel**: Perfect. By aligning our methods and findings, we can mitigate risks and push forward with confidence. Let's set a meeting to outline our next steps.

**Dr. Evans**: Sounds like a plan. We'll ensure our research truly reflects the complexity of T cell activation.
