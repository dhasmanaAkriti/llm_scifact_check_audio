Dr. Patel: Alright, everyone, let's get started. We need to discuss the recent findings on microtubule acetylation and its effect on axonal transport. 

Dr. Chen: Yes, the data suggests that increased acetylation could mitigate disruptions caused by LRRK2 Roc-COR domain mutations.

Dr. Patel: Exactly, but the question is, how reliable is this data? 

Dr. Chen: The experiments were replicated across several independent labs. The consistency is hard to ignore.

Dr. Patel: True, but isn't there a risk of focusing too narrowly on this pathway? We might overlook other contributing factors.

Dr. Chen: That's a valid concern, but I’d argue that the significance of this discovery warrants deeper exploration. If acetylation can restore transport, it could be pivotal for therapeutic strategies.

Dr. Patel: But isn't there a possibility that other mechanisms might be equally or more effective? 

Dr. Chen: Of course, but this is the first time we've seen such a direct link with transport restoration. Other mechanisms haven't shown the same potential.

Dr. Patel: What about the side effects? Any increase in acetylation could have unintended consequences on cell function.

Dr. Chen: Preliminary studies suggest that the side effects are minimal and manageable. It's about weighing the benefits against the risks.

Dr. Patel: I see your point, but we need a comprehensive approach. We can't afford to be blindsided by focusing solely on microtubule acetylation.

Dr. Chen: Agreed, a holistic view is essential. However, this could be a significant piece of the puzzle. We should at least consider integrating it into our broader strategy.

Dr. Patel: Fair enough. Let's map out the potential conflicts and align our next steps. We need to ensure we're not missing anything critical.

Dr. Chen: Absolutely. Let's gather more input from the team and refine our approach. The stakes are too high for anything less.
