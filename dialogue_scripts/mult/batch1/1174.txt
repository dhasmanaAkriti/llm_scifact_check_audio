[Setting: A conference room at a scientific symposium. Dr. Patel, a molecular biologist, is presenting her findings on PPR MDA5. Dr. Chen, a noted skeptic and geneticist, is in attendance.]

Dr. Patel: Ladies and gentlemen, the PPR MDA5 protein has been found to possess twenty N-terminal CARD domains, a discovery that could revolutionize our understanding of innate immunity.

Dr. Chen: Fascinating, Dr. Patel. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. Twenty CARD domains? That seems unprecedented. Are you suggesting an opportunity for therapeutic intervention?

Dr. Patel: Precisely, Dr. Chen. If we can harness this structure, we might enhance antiviral responses significantly. Imagine the potential for new treatments.

Dr. Chen: But have you considered the possibility of experimental error? I mean, the standard models only suggest a handful of CARD domains, not twenty.

Dr. Patel: Our data has been rigorously validated across multiple experiments. The implications are clear if we proceed with further research and potential applications.

Dr. Chen: Rigor is one thing, but replication is another. Have any independent labs confirmed these findings?

Dr. Patel: Not yet, but collaboration proposals are already underway. With your lab's expertise, we could expedite this process. This could be a strategic choice for both our teams.

Dr. Chen: You make a compelling case, but the scientific community is naturally cautious about such radical claims. How do you propose we bridge this skepticism?

Dr. Patel: By engaging in transparent, cross-institutional studies. We invite scrutiny, as it will only strengthen our case and lead to a consensus.

Dr. Chen: I see. So, you're suggesting we partner up, combine resources, and chase this opportunity together?

Dr. Patel: Exactly. We could bring about a paradigm shift in immunology. Are you willing to take this step with us?

Dr. Chen: Let's arrange a meeting with our teams. I’m curious to see where this path might lead.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. I’ll have my assistant contact yours. Together, we might just redefine what we know about immune response.

Dr. Chen: Very well, Dr. Patel. Let
