Dr. Evans: You know, Dr. Patel, there's a lot of buzz around Gpr124 and its role in increasing BBB breakdown in mouse models of ischemic stroke.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. But I have serious reservations about the implications of that claim. It seems like there's a looming threat to our current research trajectory.

Dr. Evans: A threat? How so? The data seems pretty conclusive from what I’ve seen.

Dr. Patel: Well, the conclusive nature of that data is precisely where I take issue. We're basing our understanding on a limited set of trials. The scope is too narrow to apply broadly, particularly when considering potential therapeutic applications.

Dr. Evans: I get your point. But the preliminary data is compelling. It could redefine how we approach the blood-brain barrier in stroke therapy, right?

Dr. Patel: But isn't it premature to push for application without more robust validation? We risk misleading the community and diverting funds from other promising avenues.

Dr. Evans: True, but we also risk missing out on a breakthrough if we don't explore it further. There's always a risk-benefit balance in research.

Dr. Patel: I agree, but the benefit here is speculative at best. My concern is the pressure it might put on us to pivot resources prematurely. That could be detrimental.

Dr. Evans: So, you’re suggesting we hold off on integrating this into our current projects?

Dr. Patel: Not exactly. I'm suggesting we define our next steps carefully. Perhaps a more diverse set of models or collaborative validation studies could provide clarity.

Dr. Evans: Okay, so we need to map out our disagreements here. I see the potential for immediate exploration, whereas you advocate for a cautious, validated approach.

Dr. Patel: Precisely. It’s about ensuring our next steps are scientifically sound, without succumbing to the allure of the newest 'hot topic.'

Dr. Evans: Fair enough, Dr. Patel. Let's set a meeting to outline a strategy that addresses both our concerns.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. That sounds like a productive way forward.
