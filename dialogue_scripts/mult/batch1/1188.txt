Dr. Collins: So, I understand you’ve been looking into the role of activator E2Fs.

Dr. Ramirez: Yes, indeed. I believe their ability to prevent cell death is limited to terminally differentiated cells.

Dr. Collins: That’s an intriguing claim. But as you know, the broader scientific community leans towards their universal applicability.

Dr. Ramirez: True, but our latest findings suggest otherwise. In our trials, activator E2Fs didn’t prevent apoptosis in proliferating cells.

Dr. Collins: That’s quite contrary to established research. Are you suggesting the previous studies were flawed?

Dr. Ramirez: Not necessarily flawed, but perhaps interpreted too broadly. The distinction between cell types is crucial.

Dr. Collins: I see. What about the implications for cancer research? If E2Fs are limited in scope, that could change therapeutic strategies.

Dr. Ramirez: Exactly. That’s where the opportunity lies. We could tailor treatments more effectively, focusing on cells where E2Fs truly make a difference.

Dr. Collins: But you must understand, shifting the paradigm requires more than preliminary findings. Do you have substantial data?

Dr. Ramirez: We’re compiling it. The preliminary results are promising, but I’m aware of the need for comprehensive evidence.

Dr. Collins: And how do you plan to present this to the community? There will be skeptics.

Dr. Ramirez: I’m prepared for that. I intend to publish detailed reports and host a symposium to discuss these findings.

Dr. Collins: A bold move. But if your theory holds, it could redefine aspects of cell biology.

Dr. Ramirez: Precisely. That’s why it’s imperative to explore this disagreement fully.

Dr. Collins: Well, I’ll be following your progress closely. If you need a collaborator to validate your work, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Dr. Ramirez: Thank you, Dr. Collins. Your support would be invaluable in navigating this complex issue.
