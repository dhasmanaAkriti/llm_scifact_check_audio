Practitioner: So, Dr. Allen, I noticed you approved the monoclonal antibody treatment targeting N-cadherin for the trial. 

Decision-Maker: Yes, I did. It's a promising approach. Why do you ask, Dr. Gupta?

Practitioner: Well, there's a concern. Recent studies suggest that targeting N-cadherin might actually encourage metastasis rather than inhibit it. 

Decision-Maker: That's interesting. But the data I reviewed indicated suppression of tumor growth. Are you sure about this?

Practitioner: Absolutely. The latest paper from the Journal of Oncology detailed experiments where increased metastasis was observed in models using this antibody.

Decision-Maker: Could it be a specific subtype of cancer where this applies?

Practitioner: It was tested across multiple types, including breast and prostate cancers. The consistency of the results was quite alarming.

Decision-Maker: This is quite a contradiction to what we've based our trial on. How did we miss this?

Practitioner: It's possible the initial reports we had were based on preliminary data. This new information is more comprehensive. 

Decision-Maker: So, you're suggesting we halt the trial?

Practitioner: At the very least, we need to reassess. There's a risk of harm if we proceed under the current premise.

Decision-Maker: Understood. But halting the trial could set us back significantly. Can we adjust the protocol instead of stopping it completely?

Practitioner: We could, but we'd need to consult with the research team to ensure patient safety. Perhaps modify the target or explore combination therapies that mitigate the risk.

Decision-Maker: This is a setback, indeed. Let's convene a meeting with the team and review the new data. Your insight is invaluable here, Dr. Gupta.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Allen. I just want to ensure we're doing what's best for the patients.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's make sure we're fully informed before making any decisions.
