Practitioner: So, it seems we've hit a bit of a snag with our new sweetener product. Have you heard about the recent findings on sweet taste receptors?

Decision-Maker: Only bits and pieces. Something about glucose levels affecting taste perceptions?

Practitioner: Exactly. The study shows that sweet taste receptors on the tongue are deactivated by between 1 and 10 mM glucose.

Decision-Maker: And this poses a threat to our product because...?

Practitioner: If our sweetener elevates glucose concentrations in that range, it might actually suppress sweetness perception rather than enhance it. 

Decision-Maker: That's concerning. Could this impact our market positioning? 

Practitioner: Potentially, yes. If our product doesn't taste as sweet as advertised, it could hurt our brand credibility. People might prefer alternatives.

Decision-Maker: So, what's our move here? Reformulate, or is there another approach?

Practitioner: Reformulation is one option. We could also consider educating consumers about how to use our product in ways that minimize the glucose impact.

Decision-Maker: But wouldn't that place a burden on the consumer? 

Practitioner: True, but if we inform them properly, we empower them to make better choices. It's about transparency. 

Decision-Maker: I see the point. Education could definitely be a strategic move. But reformulation sounds more immediate. Can it be done without significant cost?

Practitioner: It depends on the complexity. But I believe with minor tweaks, it could be both cost-effective and timely.

Decision-Maker: Alright, let's proceed with a feasibility study on both fronts—reformulation and consumer education. I need a solid plan before we present this to the board.

Practitioner: Absolutely. I'll get the team working on those projections immediately.

Decision-Maker: Great. Let's ensure we're not blindsided by this. Thanks for bringing it to my attention and laying out our options clearly.

Practitioner: My pleasure. We'll get this sorted out.
