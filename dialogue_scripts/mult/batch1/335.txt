Dr. Patel: So, Dr. Lewis, the new study proposes that the deregulation of HAND2 is a crucial step in endometrial carcinogenesis in mice. It's an intriguing opportunity for further research, don’t you think?

Dr. Lewis: Hmm, intriguing, yes, but I’m not convinced it’s as groundbreaking as they make it sound. We've seen many promising leads in mouse models that don’t translate to humans.

Dr. Patel: True, but the specificity of HAND2 deregulation in this context opens up a potential pathway for targeted therapies. If we can understand it in mice, it might lead to breakthroughs in human treatments.

Dr. Lewis: But isn't it a bit premature to focus our efforts there? The leap from mice to humans is substantial. We've been down this road before.

Dr. Patel: That’s a valid point. However, this isn't just any pathway; HAND2 is involved in essential regulatory processes. The potential gain in understanding its role could be worth the risk.

Dr. Lewis: I’m just cautious, Dr. Patel. We've got limited resources and I’d rather see them directed towards more immediately viable projects.

Dr. Patel: I understand your caution, but consider this: by pursuing this line of inquiry, we could pioneer a new aspect of cancer biology. If successful, it could attract significant funding and, more importantly, save lives.

Dr. Lewis: True, the potential is there. But we need to ensure solid preliminary data before diving in. Perhaps a smaller, focused study first?

Dr. Patel: I agree. A pilot study could help solidify our understanding and provide the evidence we need to justify further investment.

Dr. Lewis: Alright, then. Let’s draft a proposal for a pilot. If the initial results are promising, we can consider scaling up.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. I’ll start working on the proposal outline. Let's pioneer this path responsibly.

Dr. Lewis: Sounds like a plan. Let’s see where this opportunity takes us.
