Dr. Lee: So, Dr. Patel, I came across this study suggesting that systemic immunosuppressive therapy increases the chance of cancer mortality in patients with inflammatory eye disease.

Dr. Patel: Yes, I’ve read that too. It’s quite alarming, isn’t it? Especially since IS therapy is our go-to for managing severe IED symptoms.

Dr. Lee: Exactly. The threat here is significant, and we need to understand the implications. If this claim holds, we might need to reconsider our treatment protocols.

Dr. Patel: True, but we shouldn’t jump to conclusions just yet. The study’s methodology needs thorough examination. Was it a large enough sample size? Were there other contributing factors?

Dr. Lee: Good point. We definitely need to dig deeper. But in the meantime, should we discuss alternative treatments with our patients or at least inform them of the potential risks?

Dr. Patel: Perhaps. Transparency is crucial, but we must avoid causing unnecessary panic. We could start by discussing it with the team at our next meeting, gather more insights, and then decide on a comprehensive communication strategy.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. But what about our current patients on IS therapy? Should we monitor them more closely for early signs of cancer?

Dr. Patel: That seems prudent. Increased vigilance could help us catch any complications early. We should also consult with oncologists to establish a protocol for monitoring.

Dr. Lee: Absolutely. So, we’ll prepare to present this to the team. I’ll draft an initial report outlining our concerns and potential actions.

Dr. Patel: And I’ll reach out to oncology for a collaborative approach. Let’s aim for a balanced decision that safeguards our patients’ health while considering all data.

Dr. Lee: Sounds like a plan. Let’s meet again once we’ve gathered more information and feedback. Thanks, Dr. Patel.

Dr. Patel: Thank you, Dr. Lee. We’ll tackle this together.
