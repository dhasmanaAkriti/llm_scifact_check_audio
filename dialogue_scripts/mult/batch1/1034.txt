Speaker 1: So, recently there's been a lot of buzz about this new policy from the National Research Council. They're pushing for more efficient reprogramming in SCNT experiments. What's your take on this?

Speaker 2: It's interesting, especially considering the claim that removal of H3K9me3 by expressing certain H3K9 demethylases could decrease reprogramming efficiency. I think it's a crucial point for us to consider.

Speaker 1: Right, but isn't it a bit counterintuitive? I mean, wouldn't you expect that removing a repressive mark like H3K9me3 would actually aid in reprogramming?

Speaker 2: You'd think so, yes. But the science behind this is quite complex. The removal isn't just about lifting repression; it's about the delicate balance and timing of these epigenetic marks during reprogramming. Disrupting that balance could actually hinder rather than help.

Speaker 1: That makes sense. So, how should this influence our current practices? Should we be focusing on optimizing other parts of the process instead?

Speaker 2: Precisely. I believe that understanding the precise role and timing of H3K9me3 during these experiments is key. Instead of just removing it, we might need to study how it interacts with other factors to enhance efficiency.

Speaker 1: So, what do you suggest as a first step for researchers like us?

Speaker 2: First, we need to gather more empirical data. Conduct experiments that specifically focus on the timing and context of H3K9me3 removal. We also need to look into alternative strategies that might synergize with its presence rather than simply removing it.

Speaker 1: That's a solid plan. I think with the right data, we can better inform future policies and practices. It's about empowering researchers to make informed decisions based on comprehensive evidence.

Speaker 2: Exactly. With the right approach, we can not only comply with the new policy but also advance the field in a meaningful way. Let's start a collaborative study to explore these possibilities.

Speaker 1: I'm on board. Let's do it.
