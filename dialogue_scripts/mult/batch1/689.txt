Dr. Carter: Good morning, Ms. Henderson. I understand you’ve received our recent data on radiation exposure?

Ms. Henderson: Yes, Dr. Carter. I saw the report on the markers of mesenchymal stem cells. Less than 10% activation, correct?

Dr. Carter: Precisely. Quite unexpected, given the historical data suggesting higher activation rates.

Ms. Henderson: Right, and I must say, it's quite relieving, but also raises questions. How certain are we about these findings?

Dr. Carter: The team has double-checked the data. It's solid. But this discovery prompts further investigation into the factors influencing these low activation rates.

Ms. Henderson: Agreed. Could it be related to the type or duration of radiation exposure? Or perhaps the patients' predispositions?

Dr. Carter: Both are viable considerations. We’re also exploring environmental factors and genetic variations among the patients.

Ms. Henderson: That makes sense. But how do we proceed to ensure the safety protocols are up to par with this new understanding?

Dr. Carter: We need to align on a comprehensive study to corroborate these findings. More extensive sampling and perhaps longitudinal tracking of patients.

Ms. Henderson: I’m on board with that. It’s crucial we adjust our safety guidelines accordingly. Have you considered the impact on current treatment protocols?

Dr. Carter: Absolutely. We must remain cautious. Until we have more conclusive evidence, we’ll maintain present protocols but prepare for potential adjustments.

Ms. Henderson: So, a collaborative approach with frequent updates, then?

Dr. Carter: Precisely, Ms. Henderson. Our goal is to ensure patient safety while expanding our understanding. Your support in this endeavor is invaluable.

Ms. Henderson: Thank you, Dr. Carter. Let's keep the communication open. Our alignment is crucial for the safety and advancement of our treatments.

Dr. Carter: Agreed. Let’s reconvene at the end of the month with updates. Together, we’ll navigate these findings effectively.

Ms. Henderson: Looking forward to it. Thank you for your leadership, Dr. Carter.
