Dr. Lewis: Welcome to the seminar, everyone. Today, we're diving into the latest claim that pyridostatin deregulates G2/M progression. Exciting times in the world of cell biology!

Dr. Kim: Exciting, indeed, Dr. Lewis, but isn't it premature to say pyridostatin definitively affects G2/M progression without more comprehensive data?

Dr. Lewis: Well, Dr. Kim, the preliminary studies have shown promising results. The compound appears to induce DNA damage, consequently delaying the G2/M transition.

Dr. Kim: But those studies rely heavily on in vitro experiments. How do we know these effects aren't artefacts of the lab environment?

Dr. Lewis: That's a valid point. However, the results have been consistent across multiple cell lines, which suggests a broader applicability.

Dr. Kim: Yet, without in vivo evidence, can we truly claim this as an opportunity for therapeutic development?

Dr. Lewis: I understand your skepticism, but consider this: if pyridostatin can be shown to selectively target cancer cells in vivo, it could revolutionize our approach to cancer therapy.

Dr. Kim: Revolutionize, or divert resources from more established avenues? We've seen compounds with initial promise fall flat once they hit clinical trials.

Dr. Lewis: True, but every breakthrough starts with a leap of faith in an untested idea. Isn't it worth exploring further?

Dr. Kim: Exploration is one thing, but I worry about overhyping results. It could lead to misallocation of funding.

Dr. Lewis: I believe it's about balancing caution with curiosity. If we don't chase these leads, we might miss transformative discoveries.

Dr. Kim: Fair enough. Perhaps a more measured approach, ensuring rigorous in vivo studies, could validate the claim without inflating expectations.

Dr. Lewis: Agreed, Dr. Kim. Let's push for more studies, with a critical eye, to either solidify or refute pyridostatin's role in cell cycle regulation. It's the scientific pursuit of truth, after all.

Dr. Kim: And that’s an opportunity worth taking.
