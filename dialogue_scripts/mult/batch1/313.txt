Advocate: Alright, we've got this new data on de novo assembly. It’s pretty groundbreaking, actually.

Skeptic: Groundbreaking, huh? What's this about?

Advocate: Well, it turns out that de novo assembly results in shorter contigs than when we leave the sequence data unassembled. 

Skeptic: Shorter contigs? Are you sure? That sounds counterintuitive. I mean, assembly should give us more comprehensive sequences, right?

Advocate: That's the common belief, yes. But the latest results show otherwise. The method itself fragments the data more than we expected.

Skeptic: So, you're saying all our previous assumptions about assembly were wrong?

Advocate: Not entirely wrong, but this discovery suggests we need to reconsider our approach. If we don't adapt, we might miss out on crucial insights.

Skeptic: Alright, but how reliable is this new data? Could it just be an anomaly?

Advocate: It’s been replicated several times across different labs. The results are consistent. 

Skeptic: And what does this mean for our current projects? Do we halt everything and reassess, or...?

Advocate: That's exactly what we need to decide. Do we continue with the old methods, or do we pivot based on this new information?

Skeptic: We can't just abandon everything on a whim. The stakes are too high.

Advocate: True, but ignoring the data could be just as costly. We need to act, with caution, of course.

Skeptic: So, we need a plan. Maybe a phased approach? Test this new method alongside our current processes?

Advocate: I think that's wise. We gather more data, validate findings, and then decide on a full shift if the results hold.

Skeptic: Alright, let’s get the team together and chart this path forward. Balancing caution with innovation is key.

Advocate: Agreed. Let's make sure we're making informed decisions, not just safe ones.
