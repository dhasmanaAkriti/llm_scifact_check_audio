Speaker 1: Welcome everyone. Today we have an intriguing topic on the table, the role of the Sbds gene in mesenchymal stem and progenitor cells, specifically when deleted in mice. Dr. Emily Johnson, a leading researcher in this field, is here to shed light on this. Good morning, Dr. Johnson.

Speaker 2: Good morning. Thank you for having me.

Speaker 1: So, Dr. Johnson, the claim is that the homozygous deletion of the murine Sbds gene from osterix-expressing MPCs induces oxidative stress. Can you break that down for us?

Speaker 2: Absolutely. In simple terms, when we remove both copies of the Sbds gene in certain stem cells in mice, it creates an environment of oxidative stress. This stress can affect how cells function and survive, which is crucial for understanding diseases like bone marrow failure.

Speaker 1: Fascinating. But why should our audience care about oxidative stress in these specific cells?

Speaker 2: That's a great question. Oxidative stress is like rust on a car. It damages the cells and can accelerate aging and disease processes. By understanding these mechanisms, we can potentially develop therapies to combat related conditions in humans.

Speaker 1: So, is there a broader implication for human health?

Speaker 2: Definitely. The opportunity lies in the potential to translate these findings into treatments for bone and blood disorders. If we can mitigate oxidative stress in these cells, we might improve patient outcomes significantly.

Speaker 1: I see. So, what would you say to those who are skeptical about the impact of this research?

Speaker 2: I'd say that this research is a stepping stone. Science is about building knowledge. Each discovery, no matter how niche it seems, contributes to a larger understanding that can lead to breakthroughs.

Speaker 1: Thank you, Dr. Johnson. It’s clear that the potential gains from this research could be significant, and your insights certainly help us see the broader picture. 

Speaker 2: Thank you. It's been a pleasure to discuss it with you all.
