 Scientific claim: C2 works synergistically with A-769662 to activate dephosphorylated AMPK. 
 Participant Dynamics: Practitioner vs. Decision-Maker 
 Contextual Arena: The Exploratory Arena (goal: to brainstorm and understand) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Define the Disagreement (map out points of conflict)

Practitioner: So, the new directive from the board is pushing for us to explore the synergy between C2 and A-769662 in activating dephosphorylated AMPK.

Decision-Maker: Yes, I saw that. But isn't this claim a bit... speculative? I mean, what makes them think these compounds will work synergistically?

Practitioner: Well, the preliminary studies suggest that C2 enhances the efficacy of A-769662. It’s not just an arbitrary claim.

Decision-Maker: But "suggest" is the key word here, isn't it? We need solid evidence before we can commit resources. The last thing we want is to invest heavily without a guarantee of results.

Practitioner: True, but scientific exploration often starts with a hypothesis. The potential here could be groundbreaking. If they do activate dephosphorylated AMPK together, it could open new avenues for metabolic treatment.

Decision-Maker: I understand the potential, but with the new policy demanding higher scrutiny on experimental research, we have to be cautious. The board is concerned about the financial risks.

Practitioner: Caution is warranted, but innovation often involves calculated risks. We can design a pilot study to minimize expenses while gathering more data.

Decision-Maker: A pilot study could be a reasonable compromise. But what about the potential conflict with our current projects? We can't afford to spread our resources too thin.

Practitioner: That's a valid concern. We could look into reallocating resources from less promising leads. This synergy could redefine our approach to AMPK activation.

Decision-Maker: Alright, let's map out the potential conflicts and synergies. We need a clear plan before moving forward. Can you draft a proposal that outlines both the opportunities and the risks?

Practitioner: Absolutely, I'll have a detailed proposal ready by the end of the week. This could be a pivotal step for us, but I agree, let's ensure we tread wisely.

Decision-Maker: Good. Let's reconvene after reviewing the proposal. I want to make sure we're all on the same page before we take any next steps.
