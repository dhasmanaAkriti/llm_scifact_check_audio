Practitioner: Dr. Collins, I see you've marked a query on the recent report about reactive oxygen species in our leukaemia study. What seems to be the confusion?

Decision-Maker: Yes, Dr. Nguyen, the report mentions that activated oncogenes increase genomic instability in leukaemia cells through reactive oxygen species. I'm struggling to connect this to our treatment strategy.

Practitioner: Ah, I see. This is a crucial point. Reactive oxygen species, or ROS, are like tiny saboteurs. When oncogenes are activated, they generate more ROS, which in turn damages the DNA, leading to genomic instability. This instability is a hallmark of cancer progression.

Decision-Maker: So, you're saying the ROS are both a byproduct and a driver of the cancer process?

Practitioner: Precisely. They contribute to the chaos within cancer cells, making them more aggressive. Understanding this mechanism helps us target the cancer more effectively.

Decision-Maker: But isn't ROS generation a natural process in cells? How can we distinguish between normal and harmful levels?

Practitioner: Great question. Cells have antioxidant systems to manage normal ROS levels. In leukaemia, these systems are overwhelmed by the excess ROS from oncogenes. We're working on therapies that either bolster these antioxidant defenses or directly neutralize the excess ROS.

Decision-Maker: So, the treatment could focus on reducing ROS to stabilize the genome and slow cancer progression?

Practitioner: Exactly, Dr. Collins. By targeting ROS, we can potentially restore some genomic stability and improve treatment outcomes.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Nguyen. This clears up the confusion. I feel more confident about discussing these strategies with the board now.

Practitioner: I'm glad to hear that. It's a complex topic, but understanding it empowers us to make informed decisions for our patients' sake.

Decision-Maker: Indeed, it does. Let's ensure we communicate this effectively to our team. Thanks again for your clarity.

Practitioner: Anytime, Dr. Collins. Let's keep the conversation going.
