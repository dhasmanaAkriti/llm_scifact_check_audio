Dr. Patel: So, I assume you've read the recent paper on tuberculosis-induced granulomas?

Dr. Kim: Yes, indeed. The claim about differing immune system protein signatures is quite intriguing.

Dr. Patel: Intriguing, yes, but also contentious. The implications for our current treatment strategies are significant.

Dr. Kim: I agree, but I'm not entirely convinced. The data, while compelling, seems preliminary. The sample size was notably small.

Dr. Patel: True, but the methodology was robust. The use of advanced proteomics offers a new lens. We can't ignore the potential for developing targeted therapies.

Dr. Kim: Potential, certainly. Yet, I'm concerned about overestimating the impact. If the surrounding tissue exhibits a different signature, it could mean multiple pathways are involved, complicating treatment.

Dr. Patel: That's a fair point. However, wouldn't that complexity merit further exploration rather than skepticism? We might be on the brink of a paradigm shift in our understanding.

Dr. Kim: Paradigm shift or not, we need reproducibility. If we rush into strategic decisions based on this, we risk allocating resources prematurely.

Dr. Patel: But waiting might mean missing an opportunity. We need to weigh the urgency against the need for thorough validation. 

Dr. Kim: Agreed. Perhaps a middle ground is expanding the study with a focus on diverse populations. This could provide more definitive insights.

Dr. Patel: That's a sound approach. It seems we both acknowledge the discovery's potential but differ on how to proceed strategically.

Dr. Kim: Exactly. Let's propose a collaborative study, ensuring we're not sidelining an important discovery while maintaining scientific rigor.

Dr. Patel: Perfect. Let's draft a proposal outlining our concerns and the need for further investigation. We should present this to the board next week.

Dr. Kim: Agreed. I'll start gathering additional data points for our argument.

Dr. Patel: Excellent. Let's aim to refine our approach without dismissing the novelty of the findings. We owe it to our field.
