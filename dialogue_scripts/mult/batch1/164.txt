Speaker 1: So, there's this new study out. It claims that bariatric surgery might increase the risk of colorectal cancer. 

Speaker 2: Seriously? That's a pretty bold statement. Who published it?

Speaker 1: A research team from the University of Toronto. They presented it at the International Conference on Obesity last week.

Speaker 2: Alright, let's break this down. We've considered bariatric surgery for our patients for its benefits. How solid is their data?

Speaker 1: They followed over 12,000 patients for a decade. Their findings showed a significant uptick in colorectal cancer rates compared to the general population.

Speaker 2: Okay, but are they accounting for the patients' pre-surgery conditions? Obesity itself is a risk factor for cancer.

Speaker 1: Good point. They did adjust for that, along with other variables like age and gender. But they argue that the surgery's physiological changes might play a role.

Speaker 2: This is tricky. We know the surgery can drastically improve quality of life and reduce other obesity-related risks. Are we considering stopping recommending it?

Speaker 1: Not necessarily stopping, but we should definitely reevaluate our approach. Maybe incorporate more rigorous post-op monitoring for cancer signs.

Speaker 2: Agreed. We could also discuss this with our patients, ensuring informed consent that includes these potential risks.

Speaker 1: Yes, transparency is key. And perhaps we should collaborate with oncologists for a more comprehensive follow-up plan.

Speaker 2: I like that idea. Let's draft a proposal for our next team meeting. We need to balance the benefits of the surgery with these new concerns.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. Let's stay proactive and ensure we're making the best decisions for our patients' long-term health.

Speaker 2: Agreed. I'll gather more data on this before we present it. Thanks for bringing this to my attention.

Speaker 1: Anytime. It's crucial we stay informed on emerging research like this.
