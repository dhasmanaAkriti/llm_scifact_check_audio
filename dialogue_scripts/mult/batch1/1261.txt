Dr. Langford: So, Angela, I hear there's some confusion about our latest findings on leukaemia cells.

Angela: Yes, Dr. Langford. The claim that the removal of reactive oxygen species by activated oncogenes contributes to genomic instability seems contradictory to me.

Dr. Langford: Ah, I see. Let's unpack that. Typically, reactive oxygen species, or ROS, are damaging to cells, right?

Angela: Correct. They're known to cause DNA damage, so removing them should theoretically stabilize the genome, not destabilize it.

Dr. Langford: Precisely, which is why this finding is so intriguing. When oncogenes are activated, they can change the cell's environment, making it more conducive to mutations, despite the reduction in ROS.

Angela: So, it's not just about removing ROS but how the oncogenes themselves alter other pathways?

Dr. Langford: Exactly. The activated oncogenes might be compensating by destabilizing the genome through other mechanisms, like influencing DNA repair pathways or altering cell cycle checkpoints.

Angela: I see. So, the process is more complex than just the presence or absence of ROS. It’s about the entire cellular context when oncogenes are active.

Dr. Langford: You've got it. This contributes to the broader understanding of leukaemia's progression. It’s these nuanced interactions that we're trying to map out.

Angela: That makes sense. So, our focus should be on understanding these oncogene-driven pathways further?

Dr. Langford: Yes, and identifying potential therapeutic targets within those pathways. It's a dynamic puzzle, but every piece brings us closer to effective treatments.

Angela: Thanks for clarifying, Dr. Langford. I'll adjust the focus of my literature review accordingly.

Dr. Langford: Anytime, Angela. It's discussions like these that push our research forward.
