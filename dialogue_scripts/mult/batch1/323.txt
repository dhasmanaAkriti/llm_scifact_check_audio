Dr. Evans: We've all seen the recent data, right? Deleting Raptor increases G-CSF levels significantly. This could revolutionize our approach to treating neutropenia.

Dr. Lee: Good morning, Dr. Evans. I'm aware of the data, but let's not jump to conclusions. We've been down this road with promising data before, only to hit a dead end.

Dr. Evans: I understand your skepticism, Dr. Lee. However, the data is compelling. The increase in G-CSF levels could mean fewer infections and better recovery times for patients.

Dr. Lee: Sure, but have we considered the potential side effects? Altering Raptor expression might have unintended consequences. We need to look at the whole picture.

Dr. Evans: Absolutely, but every treatment has potential risks. The key is to weigh them against the benefits. The preliminary trials have shown minimal side effects so far.

Dr. Lee: Preliminary trials, yes. But those are small-scale. When we move to larger populations, unforeseen issues often arise. We need more robust data before making any strategic decisions.

Dr. Evans: I agree we need more data, but we shouldn't dismiss this opportunity. We have a chance to lead the field with this discovery. What if this is the breakthrough we've been waiting for?

Dr. Lee: It's not about dismissing it, Dr. Evans. It's about caution. We can't afford to make a strategic choice based on incomplete information. The stakes are too high.

Dr. Evans: Then how about a compromise? We proceed with a larger trial, carefully monitored. We gather more data and reassess. That way, we're not making a hasty decision, but we're not stalling progress either.

Dr. Lee: That seems reasonable. A larger trial could provide the clarity we need. Let's ensure we have robust safety protocols in place.

Dr. Evans: Agreed. I'll start drafting the proposal for the trial expansion. We'll review all safety measures as a priority.

Dr. Lee: Perfect. Let's ensure we're thorough. The potential here is enormous, but we must tread carefully.
