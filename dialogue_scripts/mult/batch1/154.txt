**Dr. Kim:** So, this new paper suggests that B3-Galectin increases cell resistance to TKIs by engaging the alternate KRAS-RalB signaling complex downstream of EGFR. Quite a bold claim, don't you think?

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely, but I’m not entirely convinced. The implications are significant. If true, it might explain why some patients don't respond to treatment. But, it feels like they're skipping a few steps in their conclusion.

**Dr. Kim:** Exactly. The alternate KRAS-RalB pathway is complex and not fully understood. They’ve linked it to B3-Galectin without addressing potential confounding factors. That’s risky.

**Dr. Patel:** And consider the threat this poses. If clinicians start adjusting therapies based on this unverified connection, the patients could suffer. We need to be certain before making such a leap.

**Dr. Kim:** Agreed. Their methodology didn’t account for how different cell lines might behave. Results from a single model can’t represent the vast heterogeneity in patients.

**Dr. Patel:** Not to mention, their data on the EGFR pathway seemed thin. It’s like they saw what they wanted to see. Confirmation bias, perhaps?

**Dr. Kim:** Precisely. And with the stakes so high, we can't afford to take these findings at face value. We should replicate the study with a more robust design.

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, and involve multiple cell lines and more extensive in vivo studies. Only then can we validate or refute this claim with confidence.

**Dr. Kim:** I’ll talk to the team. We should draft a plan to test this further. If B3-Galectin truly works this way, it's groundbreaking. But if it doesn’t, we need to ensure no one's misled.

**Dr. Patel:** Let's get the ball rolling. It’s imperative we expose any flaws before this becomes accepted wisdom. Lives depend on it.

**Dr. Kim:** Absolutely. Science demands nothing less.
