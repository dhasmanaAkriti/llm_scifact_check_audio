Dr. Lee: So, Dr. Patel, we've both been tasked with examining the impact of human cytomegalovirus on myeloid cells. We've got a bit of a situation.

Dr. Patel: Right, Dr. Lee. The preliminary data shows some significant changes in gene expression. It's concerning.

Dr. Lee: Exactly. If the infection alters gene expression, it could lead to unforeseen consequences in our clinical trials. We're looking at a potential threat to the validity of our results. 

Dr. Patel: And if that's the case, we might need to halt the study, which could set us back months.

Dr. Lee: So, do you think it's prudent to pause now and delve deeper into these gene expression changes?

Dr. Patel: It's tempting to push forward, but the risk of proceeding without clarity is too high. We could misinterpret the results, or worse, put patients at risk.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. But halting the study will have repercussions. Funding, timelines, everything gets affected.

Dr. Patel: True, but we need solid, ethical science. If we rush and get it wrong, the long-term damage to our credibility and the field could be significant.

Dr. Lee: What about re-prioritizing our resources for a focused investigation on these gene changes? Devote a team specifically to this issue while the rest work on the remaining aspects?

Dr. Patel: That sounds like a balanced approach. We maintain momentum while ensuring we address the potential threat thoroughly. 

Dr. Lee: Alright, let's propose this to the board. We emphasize the importance of understanding these changes thoroughly before proceeding.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. It's crucial to make a well-informed decision. I'll prepare the data summary for the meeting.

Dr. Lee: Perfect. Let's ensure our science stands on solid ground.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. We owe it to the patients and ourselves. Let's get this right.
