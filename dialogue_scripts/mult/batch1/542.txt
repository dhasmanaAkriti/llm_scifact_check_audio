**Dr. Lee**: So, apparently, this new study claims that IFI16 impedes STING phosphorylation and translocation, resulting in reduced activation of STING. 

**Dr. Carter**: Yes, I saw that. It's gaining quite a bit of attention, especially with the new policies emphasizing the need for innovative antiviral strategies.

**Dr. Lee**: Exactly. But I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around the implications of this finding. If true, it could drastically change our approach to targeting viral infections.

**Dr. Carter**: True, but before we jump on that bandwagon, don’t you think we should dig deeper into the methodology? How did they measure the phosphorylation levels, and what controls were used?

**Dr. Lee**: That’s a good point. The paper mentioned using western blotting techniques, but they didn’t elaborate much on the controls.

**Dr. Carter**: And what about the translocation aspect? Did they use live-cell imaging or something else to confirm it?

**Dr. Lee**: They did mention using immunofluorescence, but again, details were sparse. It’s almost like they’re glossing over critical parts.

**Dr. Carter**: That’s concerning. If IFI16 truly impedes STING, it would mean a fundamental shift in how we understand the immune response. But without solid evidence, it’s just another hypothesis.

**Dr. Lee**: Agreed. Plus, with this external mandate pushing for immediate application of new findings, we risk jumping to conclusions without thorough validation.

**Dr. Carter**: Perhaps we should replicate the study ourselves, or at least compile a list of questions and reach out to the authors for clarification.

**Dr. Lee**: Yes, let’s do that. If there’s a flaw, we need to expose it. And if it holds up, well, then we might be on the cusp of something revolutionary.

**Dr. Carter**: Agreed. Either way, it’s worth investigating further. Let's set up a time to dive deeper into this.

**Dr. Lee**: Sounds like a plan. Let’s get to the bottom of this.
