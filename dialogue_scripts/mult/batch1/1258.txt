**Dr. Larson:** So, Emily, this new policy mandates our lab to align with the latest findings on Wdr5 and Kat8. They've tied funding to it. 

**Emily:** Yes, I'm aware. But Dr. Larson, I've been reviewing the data, and I have concerns about the validity of that claim. 

**Dr. Larson:** Concerns? How so? The peer-reviewed articles seem conclusive.

**Emily:** They appear so at first glance, but the experimental design has flaws. For instance, the control conditions for the Kat8 dependency weren't rigorous enough.

**Dr. Larson:** But the recruitment of Wdr5 to its target loci is widely accepted as dependent on Kat8. It's become a cornerstone of our understanding.

**Emily:** I know, and that's why it's troubling. If the foundation is shaky, we risk building our future research on unstable ground. I replicated some experiments, and the results weren't consistent with the published data.

**Dr. Larson:** You replicated them? That's a bold move, Emily. What did you find?

**Emily:** In several trials, Wdr5 localized to its target loci without any detectable presence of Kat8. It suggests there might be alternative pathways or proteins involved.

**Dr. Larson:** This is significant. But if we push back on this, it could affect our funding. The policy is based on this claim.

**Emily:** I understand the stakes, but isn't our duty to the truth? What if we can expose this flaw and redirect the research focus to uncover the real mechanism?

**Dr. Larson:** You're right. This could lead to a deeper understanding, but it’s risky. We’ll need to present your findings to the board. It'll be a challenge, but I support you.

**Emily:** Thank you, Dr. Larson. Let's ensure our science remains robust, even if it means challenging the status quo.

**Dr. Larson:** Agreed. Let’s prepare a detailed report and tackle this head-on.
