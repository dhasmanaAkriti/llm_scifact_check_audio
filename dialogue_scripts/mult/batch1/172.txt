Practitioner: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're discussing a new scientific claim that basophils promote disease development in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, or SLE. This discovery has significant implications for our treatment protocols.

Decision-Maker: Indeed, but before we jump to conclusions, let's consider the context. A recent health policy mandates that we base any new treatment protocols strictly on robust evidence. How solid is this claim?

Practitioner: The research is compelling. Multiple studies have shown that basophils, which are a type of white blood cell, play a crucial role in the inflammatory process of SLE. By targeting them, we could potentially reduce disease activity.

Decision-Maker: But what do the studies say about clinical outcomes? It's one thing to identify a mechanism, but another to demonstrate concrete benefits in patients.

Practitioner: You're right. Preliminary trials indicate a reduction in flare-ups when basophils are inhibited. However, larger trials are needed to solidify these findings.

Decision-Maker: Our stakeholders will need more than preliminary data. The mandate requires us to ensure patient safety and efficacy beyond reasonable doubt.

Practitioner: Of course, and we are advocating for further research. However, considering the debilitating nature of SLE, even a potential reduction in flare-ups could be life-changing for patients.

Decision-Maker: I understand the urgency, but we must weigh the risks. Implementing new protocols prematurely could jeopardize patient trust and our compliance with health regulations.

Practitioner: I propose a measured approach: We can initiate a controlled rollout of the new protocol in select clinics while continuing to gather data. This way, we balance innovation with caution.

Decision-Maker: That seems reasonable. Let's draft a proposal outlining this strategy, ensuring it's in line with the new policy. We need to present it to the board with all necessary precautions highlighted.

Practitioner: Agreed. I'll get started on that. Thank you for considering the potential of this scientific advancement.

Decision-Maker: Thank you for bringing it to our attention. Let's ensure we do it right.
