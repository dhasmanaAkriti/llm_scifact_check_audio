**Dr. Harris:** Good afternoon, Dr. Patel. I've been reviewing the latest findings from our cardiovascular study, and there's something quite significant we need to discuss.

**Dr. Patel:** Afternoon, Dr. Harris. Go on, what's the discovery?

**Dr. Harris:** It appears that higher plasma levels of I-carnitine, when associated with trimethylamine N-oxide, are positively correlated with cardiovascular events in humans.

**Dr. Patel:** Interesting. This aligns with some of the concerns we've had about dietary supplements containing I-carnitine, doesn't it?

**Dr. Harris:** Precisely. It raises a lot of questions about current dietary recommendations. We need to decide how to proceed with this information.

**Dr. Patel:** Agreed. But before we jump to conclusions, let's consider the data. Are the results statistically significant?

**Dr. Harris:** Yes, the correlation was quite strong across multiple cohorts. It's compelling enough to warrant strategic action.

**Dr. Patel:** Then our immediate goal should be achieving alignment on how to communicate this to the broader medical community and the public. We don’t want to cause unnecessary panic.

**Dr. Harris:** Exactly. Perhaps a peer-reviewed publication followed by a press release? This could help guide practitioners on advising their patients more effectively.

**Dr. Patel:** That sounds reasonable. We should also consider a symposium or webinar to discuss these findings with other experts in the field.

**Dr. Harris:** I agree. Also, let's liaise with the nutritionists to update the guidelines on I-carnitine supplementation.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. We must ensure our recommendations are evidence-based and reflect the most current research. Shall we convene a team meeting to develop a comprehensive plan?

**Dr. Harris:** Yes, let's do that. I'll draft an agenda and circulate it. We need to be aligned and proactive.

**Dr. Patel:** Perfect. The sooner we act, the better we can mitigate any risks associated with these findings.

**Dr. Harris:** Agreed. Let's aim to have our strategy finalized by the end of the week.

**Dr. Patel:** Sounds like a plan. I'll see you at the meeting, Dr.
