**Dr. Stevens (Practitioner):** So, Dr. Patel, I've been reviewing the recent findings, and it appears the G34R/V mutation doesn't create a hypomethylated phenotype at the H3K36 histone.

**Dr. Patel (Decision-Maker):** Interesting. But doesn’t that contradict some of our earlier assumptions? I thought the hypomethylation was a key feature of this mutation's effect.

**Dr. Stevens:** That's what we believed, yes. However, this latest data suggests otherwise. There's a potential risk if we proceed with our current treatment plan based on outdated assumptions.

**Dr. Patel:** A risk? In what sense, exactly?

**Dr. Stevens:** Well, if we're targeting hypomethylation as a therapeutic angle and it's not actually occurring, we might be wasting resources and time. Not to mention patient outcomes could be compromised.

**Dr. Patel:** So, you're saying the mutation's impact is fundamentally different from what we've been working with. What does that mean for our approach moving forward?

**Dr. Stevens:** It means we need to pivot. We should consider focusing on other epigenetic markers that might be influenced by the mutation. We need to reassess our strategy entirely.

**Dr. Patel:** I see. But how do we ensure everyone on the team is aligned with this new understanding?

**Dr. Stevens:** A comprehensive briefing would be the starting point. We need to be transparent about the findings and the implications. And perhaps a brainstorming session to explore alternative pathways.

**Dr. Patel:** Agreed. Let's organize a meeting with the team. We need to clarify this and realign our objectives. The sooner we understand the full scope of this mutation's impact, the better.

**Dr. Stevens:** I'll get on that. It's imperative we all have a shared understanding to adjust our course effectively.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. Let’s ensure we’re operating with the most current and accurate information. Thank you, Dr. Stevens, for bringing this to my attention. 

**Dr. Stevens:** Of course. It's crucial we stay ahead of any potential pitfalls.
