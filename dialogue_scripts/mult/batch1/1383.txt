Dr. Lewis: Ladies and gentlemen, welcome. Today, we're here to discuss a groundbreaking discovery in cancer research. For years, we've focused on traditional methods, but recent data suggests aPKCz plays a pivotal role in tumour suppression. 

Dr. Parker: Dr. Lewis, could you elaborate on how aPKCz influences glutamine metabolism in this context?

Dr. Lewis: Certainly, Dr. Parker. Our team has uncovered that aPKCz modulates glutamine metabolism, a crucial nutrient pathway for cancer cells. By altering this pathway, aPKCz effectively starves the tumour, inhibiting its growth. 

Dr. Parker: Fascinating. So, you’re saying this mechanism could potentially revolutionize our approach to cancer treatment?

Dr. Lewis: Absolutely. This discovery opens new avenues for therapeutic strategies. Imagine a treatment that targets cancer cells without harming normal cells. This could drastically reduce side effects and improve patient outcomes.

Dr. Parker: However, some in the field are skeptical about moving away from established treatments. How do you address those concerns?

Dr. Lewis: Skepticism is natural, Dr. Parker. Yet, our data is robust. We've conducted extensive studies, both in vitro and in vivo, that consistently demonstrate aPKCz's tumour-suppressive abilities. It's time we empower oncologists with this knowledge.

Dr. Parker: And what would you say to our colleagues who might be hesitant to adopt this new approach?

Dr. Lewis: I'd urge them to consider the potential benefits for patients. By staying informed and open to innovation, we can collectively improve cancer care. This isn't about replacing existing treatments but enhancing them.

Dr. Parker: Thank you, Dr. Lewis. Your insights are invaluable. I look forward to seeing how this discovery will shape future cancer therapies.

Dr. Lewis: Thank you, Dr. Parker. Together, let's continue pushing the boundaries of science for the benefit of all.
