 Scientific claim: Glycan adaptation is rarely observed in the B-cell repertoire. 
 Participant Dynamics: Advocate vs. Skeptic 
 Contextual Arena: The Exploratory Arena (goal: to brainstorm and understand) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Expose a Flaw or Truth (validate or weaken the claim) 
```
Advocate: Well, the recent policy from the National Institute of Health mandates that we focus more on glycan adaptation research in the B-cell repertoire. It's an exciting time!

Skeptic: Exciting? Maybe. But isn't glycan adaptation rarely observed in B-cells? I mean, why allocate resources to something that's barely significant?

Advocate: That's precisely the point, isn't it? The rarity makes it intriguing. The NIH believes there might be unexplored potential here.

Skeptic: Unexplored potential or chasing shadows? If it's so rare, then maybe it's not as relevant as they think. Why not focus on more established pathways?

Advocate: True, it's not as prevalent as other adaptations, but its interactions might hold the key to understanding immune responses better. We need to brainstorm beyond the usual paths.

Skeptic: But where's the evidence? Has there been any conclusive research showing glycan adaptation's impact?

Advocate: Not conclusive, but there are hints. Recent studies show that even rare interactions can have significant effects. This could redefine our approach to immunology.

Skeptic: Hints aren't enough for policy changes. We need robust data before jumping on this trend. What if it's just another scientific dead end?

Advocate: That's the risk in any groundbreaking research, isn't it? Sometimes, the most unexpected findings revolutionize fields. We can't ignore possibilities due to fear of failure.

Skeptic: Fair point, but shouldn't there be a balance? Let's not divert too much attention from proven areas.

Advocate: Agreed, but the mandate encourages exploration, not replacement. A balance between curiosity and caution could lead to breakthroughs we haven't imagined yet.

Skeptic: I suppose. As long as there's a critical eye on the process, I can get behind that. But I'll need more convincing.

Advocate: And that's why we're here, to delve deeper and validate or refute these claims together. Let's keep the dialogue open.

Skeptic: Alright, let's see where this path takes us.
