Advocate: Recent studies have shown that a diminished ovarian reserve is a very strong indicator of infertility, even in an a priori non-infertile population. This discovery could change how we approach reproductive health entirely.

Skeptic: It's an interesting claim, but hasn't it been proven that many women with a low ovarian reserve conceive naturally? 

Advocate: Well, sure, there are exceptions. But the data suggests that the likelihood decreases significantly. We're talking about probabilities that could influence treatment plans.

Skeptic: Probabilities, yes, but not certainties. Shouldn't we be cautious about drawing conclusions that might cause unnecessary anxiety for women?

Advocate: Caution is important, of course. But ignoring this data could mean missing out on opportunities for early intervention. The aim isn't to induce panic but to inform and prepare.

Skeptic: But isn't there a risk of over-medicalizing a natural process? Infertility is complex and involves many factors beyond ovarian reserve.

Advocate: Absolutely, it's multifaceted. However, ovarian reserve is a crucial component. A diminished reserve is like a red flag that shouldn't be ignored.

Skeptic: Yet, we must ensure that any interventions are evidence-based and not just reactions to new findings. There's a fine line between informed caution and fear-mongering.

Advocate: I agree, but isn't it also our responsibility to act on credible data? Women deserve to have all the information to make informed choices about their reproductive health.

Skeptic: True, but let's not forget the importance of holistic evaluations. A one-size-fits-all approach could do more harm than good.

Advocate: That's why the focus should be on integrating this discovery into broader diagnostic frameworks. It's about adding another tool to the kit, not redefining the entire toolkit.

Skeptic: As long as it remains a tool and not the sole determinant, I suppose there's merit in exploring this further.

Advocate: That's all we're advocating for—a balanced, informed approach that benefits everyone involved.
