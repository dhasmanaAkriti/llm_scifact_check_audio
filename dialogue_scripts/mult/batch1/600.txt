Speaker 1: So, we’ve all heard that including pharmacists in rounding teams doesn’t change the incidence of adverse drug events. But is that really the case?

Speaker 2: That’s the claim, yes. But it seems counterintuitive, doesn’t it? Pharmacists are experts in medication management.

Speaker 1: Exactly! You’d think their expertise would reduce ADEs. I’m puzzled by the findings.

Speaker 2: I’ve read the study. They argue that pharmacists’ presence doesn’t significantly impact the ADE rate because of existing protocols already in place.

Speaker 1: But can protocols really replace the nuanced understanding of a pharmacist? 

Speaker 2: Well, that’s the point of debate. They believe protocols standardize care, reducing variability and errors.

Speaker 1: Hmm. But don’t pharmacists catch things others might miss? Like drug interactions?

Speaker 2: Absolutely, they do. But the study suggests that current systems are already robust enough to handle those issues. 

Speaker 1: So, are they saying pharmacists are redundant?

Speaker 2: Not exactly. They’re valuable, but their impact on ADEs may not be as significant as we assumed. 

Speaker 1: I see. But shouldn’t we consider the qualitative benefits they bring? Like patient education?

Speaker 2: That’s a valid point. The study focuses on quantitative outcomes, but qualitative aspects are crucial too.

Speaker 1: It sounds like we need a broader perspective, then. Maybe a mixed-methods approach?

Speaker 2: That could give us a more comprehensive view. Let’s not dismiss their role based on a single metric.

Speaker 1: Agreed. So, should we advocate for further research?

Speaker 2: Yes, more data could empower us to make informed decisions. We need to understand both the quantitative and qualitative impacts fully.

Speaker 1: Let’s push for that. The role of pharmacists is too important to overlook.

Speaker 2: Absolutely, let’s keep the conversation going.
