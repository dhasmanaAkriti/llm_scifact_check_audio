Originator: So, Carla, I've been looking at the new data from the 2D BN-PAGE gels, and it's quite revealing. The reduction of purity of cytoplasmic membranes isolated from overexpressors seems indicated by stronger spots for OmpF.

Interpreter: Hmm, that's interesting, Alex. But are you sure it’s a reduction in purity and not just a byproduct of overexpression itself?

Originator: Well, the stronger spots for OmpF suggest a higher concentration of contaminants, which typically aligns with reduced purity. We haven’t observed this in the control samples.

Interpreter: True, but stronger spots could also imply increased membrane protein content due to overexpression. It might not necessarily correlate with impurity.

Originator: I see your point, but if it were purely a result of overexpression, wouldn't we see a more uniform increase across all membrane proteins, not just OmpF?

Interpreter: Not necessarily. OmpF might be more prone to aggregation or have a higher affinity for binding in these conditions. Have we confirmed the identity of those spots as OmpF?

Originator: Yes, we ran a mass spec analysis on the spots. It matched OmpF. But I suppose it's possible that the expression conditions could be influencing its aggregation state.

Interpreter: Exactly. It's crucial to consider the environment we've created in overexpression models. It can skew results towards these kinds of anomalies.

Originator: So, you're suggesting we might need to refine our isolation protocols or adjust our interpretation of what 'purity' means in this context?

Interpreter: Precisely. We need to explore whether these OmpF spots are a genuine indication of impurity or just a characteristic of the expression scenario.

Originator: Alright, let's set up a more controlled experiment to isolate these variables. We need to be sure before drawing definitive conclusions.

Interpreter: Agreed. A deeper dive into this could reveal unexpected insights into membrane dynamics in overexpressors.

Originator: Great, let's reconvene with the new data next week. Thanks for the input, Carla.

Interpreter: Anytime, Alex. Looking forward to seeing where this leads us.
