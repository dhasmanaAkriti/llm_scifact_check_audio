Advocate: So, the idea is that cSMAC formation represses weak ligand signaling. It's a pretty straightforward concept once you see the data.

Skeptic: I get that it's straightforward for you, but I'm not entirely convinced. Let's unpack this. How does formation of cSMAC specifically suppress weak signals?

Advocate: Well, when cSMAC is formed, it essentially clusters receptors and signaling molecules together. This clustering can heighten the signal from strong ligands while diminishing those from weaker ligands. It's about selective amplification.

Skeptic: Right, but doesn’t that imply a more active selection process? I mean, wouldn't receptors still bind to weak ligands if they’re present?

Advocate: They would, but the spatial organization within cSMAC limits the transmission of those weak signals. Think of it like tuning a radio to only capture the strongest station.

Skeptic: Okay, but why can’t a weak ligand still transmit its signal, albeit at a lower intensity? Isn't that still a form of signaling?

Advocate: It technically is, but within the cSMAC, the weak signals are drowned out. It’s not just about intensity; it’s about the efficiency of signal propagation. The strong signals are more efficient and thus prioritized.

Skeptic: So, what you're saying is, it’s not that the weak signals can’t transmit at all, it’s that they’re overshadowed by the strong ones?

Advocate: Exactly. And that's why the data consistently shows that cSMAC formation depresses weak ligand signaling. It's not an elimination, it's a suppression.

Skeptic: I see. I think I understand better now. But how does this align with the instances where weak signals do result in a response?

Advocate: Those are exceptions, likely influenced by other factors outside of cSMAC formation. It’s complex, but the primary function remains suppression.

Skeptic: Alright, I think we’ve mapped out our disagreement. I’ll need to dive deeper into those exceptions. Thanks for clarifying.

Advocate: No problem. Happy to discuss further anytime.
