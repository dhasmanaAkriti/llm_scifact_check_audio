Speaker 1: So, most of us in the scientific community have been following the development of PrEP treatments in primates and humans. But recently, a study came out saying that daily subcutaneous injections of emtricitabine in rhesus macaques are ineffective at protecting against rectally transmitted simian-human immunodeficiency virus.

Speaker 2: That's right. And it's crucial we pay attention to this finding because it challenges our assumptions about PrEP's effectiveness across different administration routes.

Speaker 1: Exactly. I mean, if we can't ensure protection in our closest animal models, there's a real threat to the perceived reliability of PrEP in humans, especially considering the different routes of transmission.

Speaker 2: Agreed. But, we need to dig deeper. Isn't it possible that the macaques' biology or the dosing method could account for this ineffectiveness? It might not be a direct parallel to human use.

Speaker 1: That's a valid point. But think about the implications. If similar results crop up in human trials, public confidence in PrEP could plummet. The risk of undermining public health efforts is too significant to ignore.

Speaker 2: True, but shouldn't we also consider the role of combination therapies? Perhaps integrating tenofovir or altering administration methods could enhance efficacy.

Speaker 1: That's a potential pathway. But before that, we must address the immediate threat this poses to our current understanding. We need alignment on the necessity of re-evaluating our protocols and possibly adjusting guidelines.

Speaker 2: Definitely, and to achieve that, we should advocate for more comprehensive studies and collaborate with interdisciplinary teams. Aligning on a shared understanding is vital for advancing effective treatment strategies.

Speaker 1: Exactly, our priority should be ensuring the safety and efficacy of prevention methods, grounded in robust evidence. Let's push for those studies.

Speaker 2: Agreed. We can't afford to let this slip through the cracks. Let's work on a proposal to present to the committee.

Speaker 1: Sounds like a plan. I'll draft an outline, and we can refine it together.

Speaker 2: Perfect. Let's make sure we're aligned every step of the way.
