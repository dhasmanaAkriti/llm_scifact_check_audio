**Dr. Collins:** So, with this new focus on understanding protein structures, the recent claim about β-sheet opening during pleurotolysin pore formation is quite intriguing, isn't it? 

**Dr. Nguyen:** Absolutely, especially with the new regulations mandating more rigorous documentation of protein mechanisms in pharmaceuticals. It's crucial we get on the same page.

**Dr. Collins:** Right. The structural transformation is fascinating. β-sheets are typically so stable. The idea that they open up during pleurotolysin action is quite a paradigm shift.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Indeed. It implies a dynamic flexibility in proteins we didn’t fully appreciate before. But, do you think it holds up across different environments, not just in vitro?

**Dr. Collins:** That’s the crux of it, isn’t it? The data so far suggest it’s a universal mechanism, but peer review will be key. We need to ensure our methods align with these new regulatory standards.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Agreed. Our next steps should focus on replicating these findings under various conditions. That would satisfy both scientific curiosity and regulatory compliance.

**Dr. Collins:** Exactly. And, perhaps, we can explore computational models as well. They can predict how such structural changes might affect protein function in complex biological systems.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Good point. Simulations could provide insights into how pleurotolysin could be manipulated or inhibited in therapeutic contexts. 

**Dr. Collins:** Let’s aim for a joint publication. It would be a concrete step towards aligning our findings with the broader scientific framework and these new regulations.

**Dr. Nguyen:** I’m on board. If our work contributes to a deeper understanding of protein dynamics, it might pave the way for new treatments.

**Dr. Collins:** Then it’s settled. Let’s meet next week to outline our methodology and ensure we're meeting all the documentation requirements.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Sounds good. Aligning our research with this new mandate will not only keep us compliant but also push the boundaries of our field.

**Dr. Collins:** Indeed. I’m excited to see where this leads us. Until next week, then.

**Dr. Nguyen:** Until next week, Dr.
