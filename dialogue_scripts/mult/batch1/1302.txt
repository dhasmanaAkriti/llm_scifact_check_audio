Dr. Collins: Our latest study asserts that Tirasemtiv has no effect on cardiac muscle. This puts us at a crossroads. 

Dr. Patel: That's a bold claim, Dr. Collins. But if true, it might significantly shift our strategic focus. Can you elaborate on the data?

Dr. Collins: Certainly. The trials showed no significant difference in cardiac muscle contractility or output. We expected it to enhance muscle strength, but in this case, it didn't.

Dr. Patel: So, if Tirasemtiv doesn't benefit cardiac performance, are we still considering further investment in its development for cardiac applications?

Dr. Collins: That's precisely the dilemma. The board wants a decision by next week. Continuing might drain resources without viable returns.

Dr. Patel: Understood. But isn't there a risk of losing potential benefits in other areas, like skeletal muscle? Could those findings influence our choice?

Dr. Collins: Yes, there's promise in treating neuromuscular disorders. However, if we pursue that, we'll need to realign our resources and potentially face a longer timeline for returns.

Dr. Patel: The threat here is clear then. If we focus solely on skeletal muscle applications, we risk falling behind competitors in cardiac innovation.

Dr. Collins: Exactly. It's a strategic gamble. Do we pivot now, or continue in both areas and risk spreading ourselves thin?

Dr. Patel: Let's convene a panel with our key stakeholders. We need their insights before making a final decision. We can't afford to overlook any angle in this.

Dr. Collins: Agreed. I'll arrange for an in-depth review. We need to ensure that we make a choice that's beneficial in the long haul.

Dr. Patel: I'll assist. Let's aim for a decision that balances innovation with practicality. We owe it to our patients and investors.

Dr. Collins: Perfect. Let's move forward with that plan. Thank you, Dr. Patel.
