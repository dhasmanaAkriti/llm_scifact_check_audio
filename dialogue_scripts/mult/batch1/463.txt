**Dr. Foster:** So, Dr. Lee, the new policy mandates we incorporate genomic sequencing in all metastatic cancer cases. What do you make of it?

**Dr. Lee:** Honestly, Foster, the claim that "genomic aberrations of metastases provide information for targeted therapy" sounds compelling. But I'm skeptical about its blanket application.

**Dr. Foster:** I hear you, Lee. But isn't the idea to tailor treatments more precisely? Personalized medicine is the future, after all.

**Dr. Lee:** True, but we're treating people, not just genomes. There’s a risk of over-reliance on genomic data. Not every aberration translates into actionable therapy.

**Dr. Foster:** Fair point. Yet, the sequencing can reveal mutations not evident in the primary tumor, giving us a clearer target.

**Dr. Lee:** Sure, but there are cases where identifying those mutations hasn’t significantly changed patient outcomes. The therapy might not work for everyone.

**Dr. Foster:** So, you're saying it’s not foolproof?

**Dr. Lee:** Exactly. And it raises ethical concerns too. What happens when we find mutations we can't address or those that suggest a poor prognosis?

**Dr. Foster:** That’s a tough one. But isn't it better to know and explore all options, even if they lead to difficult conversations?

**Dr. Lee:** I agree with transparency, but we need to manage expectations. Patients might assume genomic findings guarantee a breakthrough treatment when it's often more nuanced.

**Dr. Foster:** So, how do we balance this? Embrace the science while keeping expectations realistic?

**Dr. Lee:** Precisely. We should integrate genomic data with clinical judgment. It’s a tool, not a panacea.

**Dr. Foster:** Agreed. Let's advocate for comprehensive discussions with our patients. They deserve clarity, not just hope.

**Dr. Lee:** Yes, and maybe we should push for more research to validate these genomic targets before making them the cornerstone of our approach.

**Dr. Foster:** Sounds like a plan, Lee. Let's keep questioning and refining. It’s the only way forward.
