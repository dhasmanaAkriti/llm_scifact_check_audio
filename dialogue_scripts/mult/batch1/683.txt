Speaker 1: Good afternoon, everyone. We're here to discuss a fascinating claim regarding the role of FGF21 in mice and its impact on atherosclerotic plaque formation. 

Speaker 2: Right, and I must say, the claim that a lack of FGF21 actually slows down plaque formation is quite intriguing. But, let's dig deeper into that.

Speaker 1: Absolutely. Recent studies suggest that removing FGF21 in mice reduces the rate at which these plaques form. It's a breakthrough that could reshape how we understand cardiovascular diseases.

Speaker 2: But isn't it premature to make such definitive claims? I mean, we're talking about mice, not humans. The physiological differences are significant.

Speaker 1: True, but the underlying mechanisms often provide invaluable insights. If FGF21 contributes to plaque formation, then this could lead to new therapeutic targets in humans.

Speaker 2: Sure, but let's not forget the complexity of human biology. Translating findings from mice to humans is rarely straightforward. Could it be that the absence of FGF21 triggers other compensatory mechanisms in mice that might not exist in humans?

Speaker 1: That's a valid point. However, the consistency in the data across multiple studies cannot be ignored. It suggests a fundamental role of FGF21 in lipid metabolism.

Speaker 2: Yet, we must remain cautious. The external mandate pushing for rapid translation of animal studies to human applications could lead to premature and potentially unsafe conclusions.

Speaker 1: Agreed, caution is necessary. But isn't it worth exploring further? Imagine the potential if this leads to a new way to prevent or manage atherosclerosis.

Speaker 2: I'm all for exploration, but with rigorous validation. Let's ensure we're not jumping the gun just because the trend demands it.

Speaker 1: Fair enough. So, we proceed with careful optimism, keeping both the promise and the pitfalls in mind.

Speaker 2: Exactly. Let's ensure our excitement is matched by sound science.
