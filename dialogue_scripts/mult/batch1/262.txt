Speaker 1: So, we're all familiar with the central dogma of molecular biology, right? DNA to RNA to protein. But today, I'm here to tell you that it's not just about the proteins. Cis-acting lncRNAs play a significant role in gene expression, especially for genes near their transcription sites.

Speaker 2: That's an interesting claim. But aren't lncRNAs usually considered non-coding and somewhat of a mystery in their function?

Speaker 1: Precisely why it's so exciting! Recent studies have shown that these lncRNAs can regulate nearby genes, effectively controlling their expression. It's a whole new layer of genetic regulation that we've only just begun to understand.

Speaker 2: Okay, but what's the opportunity here? Why should we prioritize this line of study over other genetic research?

Speaker 1: Imagine being able to precisely control gene expression in therapeutic settings. If we can harness this mechanism, we could develop new treatments for genetic disorders by turning genes on or off as needed.

Speaker 2: That does sound promising. But how do we ensure this isn't just another passing scientific fad? We've seen promising fields fade before.

Speaker 1: True, but the difference here is the growing body of empirical evidence. Labs worldwide are replicating these results. Plus, the potential for clinical applications is driving substantial investment and interest.

Speaker 2: Alright, let's say we decide to invest in this. What's our first step?

Speaker 1: We should start by funding exploratory projects that map out lncRNA interactions in various cell types. Building a comprehensive database could set the foundation for targeted therapies.

Speaker 2: Sounds like a solid plan. So, we agree to move forward with this initiative?

Speaker 1: Absolutely. By doing so, we position ourselves at the forefront of a groundbreaking field with immense therapeutic potential.

Speaker 2: Then let's make it happen.
