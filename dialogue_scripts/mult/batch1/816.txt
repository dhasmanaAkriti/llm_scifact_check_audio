**Advocate (Dr. Lee):** So, let’s dive into this, shall we? The recent study clearly shows that mutations in RIM1 raise levels of IME1 RNA. It’s groundbreaking, really.

**Skeptic (Dr. Patel):** Hold on, Dr. Lee. I’ve read that study, and while it’s intriguing, the correlation doesn’t imply causation. How can we be sure that RIM1 mutations are the direct cause?

**Dr. Lee:** Well, the experiments were quite robust. They used CRISPR to induce mutations and consistently observed elevated IME1 RNA levels. 

**Dr. Patel:** I get that, but what about the possibility of confounding variables? Gene expression can be influenced by so many factors. 

**Dr. Lee:** Absolutely, Dr. Patel. But what makes this compelling is the replication across multiple cell lines. It’s not just a fluke in one isolated environment.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but we’ve seen cases where initial findings don’t hold up under broader scrutiny. Remember the whole debacle with the ARK1 gene?

**Dr. Lee:** Of course, I remember. And that’s why I’m suggesting a collaborative effort. We should verify these results with independent labs.

**Dr. Patel:** That’s a reasonable approach. We need to ensure the data stands up to rigorous testing.

**Dr. Lee:** Exactly. Our goal should be to find a shared understanding. If these findings are accurate, it could pave the way for new therapeutic targets.

**Dr. Patel:** Agreed. Let’s proceed with caution but optimism. We’ll coordinate with our teams to replicate the study. 

**Dr. Lee:** That’s the spirit! Together, we can get to the bottom of this. I’ll have my assistant send over all the data we’ve collected so far.

**Dr. Patel:** Perfect. I’ll review it and get back to you with any insights or concerns.

**Dr. Lee:** Looking forward to it, Dr. Patel. Let’s make sure we’re on the same page as we move forward.

**Dr. Patel:** Absolutely. It’s crucial for the integrity of our
