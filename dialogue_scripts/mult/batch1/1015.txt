Speaker 1: So, the latest results from the lab are in. Rapamycin seems to delay aging in fruit flies. Quite the breakthrough, wouldn't you say?

Speaker 2: Definitely intriguing. But before we get ahead of ourselves, we need to deliberate on what this means for our research direction. 

Speaker 1: Agreed. The implications could be significant, but we have to consider if scaling up to larger organisms is feasible. Fruit flies are one thing, but mammals?

Speaker 2: Exactly. We need a strategic approach. Have you reviewed the mechanisms? How exactly is Rapamycin affecting the aging process?

Speaker 1: It's believed to target the mTOR pathway, which regulates cell growth and metabolism. But, of course, pathways in fruit flies can differ vastly from those in humans.

Speaker 2: True. But this could still be a stepping stone. The question is, do we pivot our resources to follow this lead, or do we continue with our current projects?

Speaker 1: What if we do a bit of both? Allocate a small team to start preliminary testing on mammalian models, while the rest of the team continues with the ongoing projects?

Speaker 2: That sounds balanced. But we should also consider the funding implications. Reallocating resources might require additional grants.

Speaker 1: We could draft a proposal outlining the potential benefits of Rapamycin research. If we can get early promising results, that might attract interest and funds.

Speaker 2: Yes, and it keeps us aligned with our long-term goals. Let’s prepare a presentation for the team. We need everyone’s buy-in if we’re to shift any focus.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Let’s meet tomorrow to draft it. This could be a pivotal moment for our research.

Speaker 2: Let's hope it’s the start of something big. See you tomorrow.
