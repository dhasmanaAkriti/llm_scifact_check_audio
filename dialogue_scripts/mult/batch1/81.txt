Dr. Lee: So, Dr. Patel, you've read the latest paper on acute ablation of Snail in the embryonic cortex? It's quite a claim.

Dr. Patel: Yes, I skimmed through it. They suggest it affects the proliferation and number of embryonic cortical precursors, right?

Dr. Lee: Exactly. But here's where I'm puzzled. Isn't Snail primarily a transcription factor involved in epithelial-mesenchymal transitions?

Dr. Patel: That's what I thought too. But apparently, their findings suggest a broader role. They're indicating that Snail has a significant impact on neural precursor cells.

Dr. Lee: Fascinating, but also a bit perplexing. How do they propose Snail is influencing these neural precursors?

Dr. Patel: They hypothesize that Snail modulates the signaling pathways involved in cell cycle regulation. But I'm not entirely convinced. The evidence seems... circumstantial.

Dr. Lee: I agree. It feels like a leap. Did they provide any concrete mechanistic insights?

Dr. Patel: They mentioned some downstream targets but didn't delve deeply into the pathways. I feel there's a gap in their explanation.

Dr. Lee: Perhaps we need to consider the possibility of indirect effects. Maybe Snail is part of a larger network influencing these precursors?

Dr. Patel: That could be it. We should look into other factors that might interact with Snail. It might help us understand the broader implications.

Dr. Lee: Yes, let's explore that. And we should verify their findings in our lab. Replicating their experiments could shed light on this.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's design a set of experiments that focus on those signaling pathways. Maybe we'll find the missing link.

Dr. Lee: Great. Once we have a clearer picture, we can align our understanding with their claims. Who knows, we might even uncover new aspects of Snail's role.

Dr. Patel: Exciting times ahead, Dr. Lee. Let's get to it.
