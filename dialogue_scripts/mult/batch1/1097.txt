Dr. Lewis: Dr. Chen, I understand you've been working on the knockin mouse model that's lacking the SHP-2 MAPK pathway. How is that going?

Dr. Chen: Yes, it's been quite revealing. One significant observation is the development of splenomegaly in these mice.

Dr. Lewis: Splenomegaly? That's unexpected. Could this potentially impact the interpretation of our broader study on immune responses?

Dr. Chen: That's precisely why I wanted to discuss this with you. If splenomegaly is a consistent phenotype, it might suggest that disrupting the SHP-2 MAPK pathway has wider implications than we initially thought.

Dr. Lewis: I see. This could be a threat to the integrity of our results regarding immune cell proliferation then?

Dr. Chen: Exactly. If the spleen is enlarged, it could skew the data on immune cell counts and activity. We need to determine if this is a side effect of the genetic modification or a direct result of the pathway disruption.

Dr. Lewis: Agreed. And if it's the latter, it might suggest new avenues for exploring SHP-2's role in hematopoiesis. But how do we address this in the short term?

Dr. Chen: I propose we conduct a parallel study focusing on the hematological parameters. Understanding the extent of the splenomegaly could empower us to adjust our analysis appropriately.

Dr. Lewis: That sounds like a solid plan. It’s crucial that we inform the rest of the team and adjust our experimental designs. This could be an opportunity rather than just a complication.

Dr. Chen: Precisely. By tackling it head-on, we can turn this potential threat into an insight that might even enhance our understanding of the SHP-2 MAPK pathway. 

Dr. Lewis: Agreed. Let’s get to work on that supplementary study. Your initiative here is commendable, Dr. Chen.

Dr. Chen: Thank you, Dr. Lewis. I’ll gather the preliminary data and report back with our options.
