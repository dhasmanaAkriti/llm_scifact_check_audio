Dr. Hughes: So, let’s address the genetic findings. Recent studies suggest that a single nucleotide variant in the DGKK gene is strongly associated with an increased risk of hypospadias. 

Mr. Lee: Right, Dr. Hughes. But I’m a bit perplexed. I understood that environmental factors were the primary concern for hypospadias. How does this genetic claim change our approach?

Dr. Hughes: It’s a valid point, Mr. Lee. Previously, environmental factors were heavily emphasized. However, this discovery implies a significant genetic component, which might shift how we prioritize research and resources.

Mr. Lee: So, are you suggesting we reallocate funding towards genetic research, potentially at the expense of environmental studies?

Dr. Hughes: Not necessarily at the expense, but a balanced approach could be more beneficial. Given this new data, integrating genetic research could enhance our understanding and lead to more comprehensive preventative strategies.

Mr. Lee: But, Dr. Hughes, won’t this confuse our current public health messages? We've been emphasizing lifestyle changes to minimize risk.

Dr. Hughes: It’s about expanding the narrative, not replacing it. We must communicate that both genetics and environment play roles. Our messaging can adapt to highlight the importance of a multifaceted approach.

Mr. Lee: I see. But before we decide, shouldn’t we consider the robustness of this genetic finding? How certain are we about its implications?

Dr. Hughes: That’s crucial. The data is strong, but it’s just one piece of the puzzle. Further studies are needed to validate and understand the mechanisms involved. 

Mr. Lee: Understood. So, the decision is to cautiously integrate genetic research into our strategy, while maintaining focus on environmental factors.

Dr. Hughes: Precisely. A strategic choice that embraces both aspects will likely yield the most significant advancements in preventing hypospadias.

Mr. Lee: Alright, let’s proceed with this balanced approach. Thank you for clarifying, Dr. Hughes.

Dr. Hughes: My pleasure, Mr. Lee. Let’s move forward with informed optimism.
