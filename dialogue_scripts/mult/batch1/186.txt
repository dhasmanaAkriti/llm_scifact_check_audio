Interviewer: So, today we’re exploring a rather concerning claim. A recent study suggests that British female students experience more bullying than their male counterparts. To discuss this, we have Dr. Melanie Harris, an expert in educational psychology. Good morning, Dr. Harris.

Dr. Harris: Good morning, thank you for having me.

Interviewer: Dr. Harris, could you start by explaining how this claim has come to light?

Dr. Harris: Certainly. The study in question analyzed data from several schools across the UK, focusing on reported incidents of bullying. What stood out was the higher frequency of bullying reported by female students, both in physical and online environments.

Interviewer: Some might argue that boys are just as bullied but perhaps less likely to report it. What do you make of that?

Dr. Harris: That's a valid point. The study acknowledges underreporting as a significant factor. However, even when accounting for this, the data still shows a higher prevalence among girls. This might be due to different bullying dynamics, with girls facing more relational aggression.

Interviewer: Interesting. So, what are the implications of these findings?

Dr. Harris: The implications are substantial. Schools need to tailor their anti-bullying strategies to address this gender disparity effectively. It’s an opportunity to reshape our approach to bullying prevention.

Interviewer: And what action do you propose schools take?

Dr. Harris: Schools should implement gender-specific programs that address the unique challenges faced by female students. Additionally, fostering open communication channels can encourage more boys to report their experiences.

Interviewer: So, are we deciding that schools should revise their anti-bullying policies based on this study?

Dr. Harris: Absolutely. This is an opportunity to enhance the educational environment for all students. By acknowledging and addressing these findings, schools can better support their students' well-being.

Interviewer: Thank you, Dr. Harris. It seems like a proactive approach is crucial here.

Dr. Harris: Indeed. Ensuring a safe learning environment should be a priority.

Interviewer: Thank you for your insights. 

Dr. Harris: My pleasure.
