Practitioner: Ladies and gentlemen, recent findings in our laboratory have shown that BCL-2 activation indeed antagonizes the apoptotic effects of c-Myc. This discovery could dramatically alter our approach to cancer treatment.

Decision-Maker: Thank you for that update. Before we jump to conclusions, can you elaborate on what this means for our current strategies?

Practitioner: Certainly. Conventionally, we've been targeting c-Myc to induce apoptosis in cancer cells. However, with BCL-2 activation, the apoptotic pathway is inhibited, suggesting that our current treatments could be less effective than we assumed.

Decision-Maker: So, you're suggesting a shift in our research focus. What evidence do you have to support this?

Practitioner: Our preliminary data show that in cell cultures, BCL-2 activation significantly reduced cell death even in the presence of high c-Myc expression. This was consistent across multiple trials.

Decision-Maker: That’s compelling. But are there any potential downsides if we pivot now?

Practitioner: There could be. Redirecting resources might delay other promising avenues. But if BCL-2 indeed counteracts c-Myc, our present efforts might be futile in the long term.

Decision-Maker: I see. So, what’s your recommendation? Should we initiate a new line of research focusing on BCL-2 inhibitors?

Practitioner: I recommend we start a pilot study. It’s a calculated risk, but the potential benefits in terms of treatment efficacy could be substantial.

Decision-Maker: A pilot study sounds reasonable. We need concrete data before making a full-scale shift. Prepare a detailed proposal for the next board meeting.

Practitioner: Agreed. I’ll have the proposal ready. Thank you for considering this, and I’m confident this path could yield significant advancements.

Decision-Maker: Let’s hope so. The stakes are high, and we must tread carefully but boldly.

Practitioner: Absolutely. I appreciate your support.

Decision-Maker: Let’s move forward, then. Meeting adjourned.
