Dr. Patel: So, as you know, the new research funding requires us to focus on the most promising genetic replication projects. This means reconsidering our approach to Okazaki fragment synthesis.

Dr. Lewis: I've read the mandate, but I'm skeptical about the claim that altering origin firing affects termination zones. It sounds speculative at best.

Dr. Patel: Speculative? The data is compelling. Altering origin firing can lead to significant changes in the termination zones. This could revolutionize gene therapy.

Dr. Lewis: But aren't we jumping the gun? The foundational studies are still under peer review. We need more conclusive evidence before redirecting resources.

Dr. Patel: We can't afford to wait, Lewis. The mandate is clear. Adapt or risk losing funding altogether. The potential here is immense.

Dr. Lewis: I get that, but we have to maintain scientific integrity. What if this turns out to be a dead end?

Dr. Patel: That's the nature of breakthrough research. There's always risk. But the preliminary results are promising. Imagine the implications for targeted genetic corrections.

Dr. Lewis: It's not just about risk, it's about responsibility. We have a team that relies on us to make sound decisions. What about their concerns?

Dr. Patel: I've spoken to the team. They're excited about the possibilities. The consensus is that we should proceed with a pilot study. We need to decide today, Lewis.

Dr. Lewis: Okay, but I want a contingency plan. If this doesn't pan out, we need to pivot without causing disruption.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. We'll set milestones and reassess at each stage. If the data doesn't support the hypothesis, we'll adjust our course.

Dr. Lewis: Fine. Let's proceed, but with caution. The stakes are high, and so is our responsibility.

Dr. Patel: Absolutely. Let's make this decision work for us and the future of genetic research.
