Advocate: So, the crux of the issue is this: In breast cancer, the loss of myoepithelial cells promotes the transition from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma.

Skeptic: That sounds like a big claim. What exactly are these myoepithelial cells doing that’s so critical?

Advocate: They're like the guardians of the ductal structure. When they disappear, it’s like the walls of a castle crumbling down, allowing the cancer to invade surrounding tissues.

Skeptic: But isn't the real threat the genetic mutations within the tumor cells themselves? How can you be sure it’s the loss of these cells that’s the main driver?

Advocate: Well, recent studies have shown that without these cells, the structural integrity is compromised. It’s not just about the mutations; it’s about the environment those cells create—or fail to create.

Skeptic: But the risk here is oversimplifying a complex process. We might be missing the forest for the trees. Could it be that these cells are just a part of a much larger picture?

Advocate: Sure, they’re part of a larger picture, but understanding their role could be key to new interventions. If we can prevent their loss, we might stop the cancer from becoming invasive.

Skeptic: Yet, by focusing solely on these cells, aren't we potentially ignoring other critical factors? Like, what about the immune response or the role of other surrounding cell types?

Advocate: Absolutely, those are valid concerns. But defining disagreements like this helps us tailor our research. If we map out what we know—and what we don't—we can develop a more holistic approach.

Skeptic: So, you’re saying it’s about finding the balance? Understanding where these cells fit in the grand scheme of cancer progression?

Advocate: Exactly. It’s about exploring every angle to see what truly drives the progression and how we can intervene most effectively.

Skeptic: Alright, I can get behind that. Let's keep digging.

Advocate: Agreed. We’re just scratching the surface.
