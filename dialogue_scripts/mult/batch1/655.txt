Dr. Morrison: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we're delving into a groundbreaking study claiming that intra-cerebroventricular infusion of amyloid-β oligomers reduces expression of fibronectin type-III domain-containing protein 5 mRNA in mice hippocampi.

Dr. Chen: Indeed, Dr. Morrison. But let's not get ahead of ourselves. The implications of this finding are not as straightforward as they seem.

Dr. Morrison: Dr. Chen, surely you see the potential here? With the new policy mandating increased funding for neurological research, this could be a key area of focus.

Dr. Chen: I agree the funding is welcome, but the study's methodology raises questions. We need more than just one paper to redirect our focus.

Dr. Morrison: Yet, this could revolutionize our understanding of Alzheimer's. Imagine the possibilities if we could modulate fibronectin type-III domain proteins.

Dr. Chen: True, but the study's sample size was small and limited to mice. Scaling this to human application is a significant leap.

Dr. Morrison: Isn't that the nature of scientific progress? We start small and expand. The initial results are promising enough to warrant further exploration.

Dr. Chen: You're not wrong, but let's consider the potential side effects. The systemic impact of amyloid-β isn't fully understood yet. 

Dr. Morrison: That's precisely why we need more research, to map out these unknowns. The new policy provides us a rare opportunity to dig deeper.

Dr. Chen: Absolutely, but we must approach this with caution. Rushing into large-scale studies without thorough groundwork could backfire.

Dr. Morrison: I agree, caution is necessary. However, let's not let caution stifle innovation. We must balance skepticism with curiosity.

Dr. Chen: Then perhaps our disagreement lies in the pace of progress. We both want what's best for advancing neurological science, but let's ensure it's on a solid foundation.

Dr. Morrison: A solid foundation, yes. But let’s not forget, sometimes a leap of faith is what propels us forward.
