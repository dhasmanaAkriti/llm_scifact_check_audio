Speaker 1: So, recently, there’s been a lot of buzz about the new energy policy mandate focusing on sustainable technologies. It seems like the perfect time to discuss the advances in OER catalysts, don't you think?

Speaker 2: Absolutely. The improvements in oxygen evolution reaction catalysts are showing stable activity over several hundred hours. It's a game-changer for sustainable energy solutions.

Speaker 1: Right, especially with the external mandate pushing for cleaner energy sources. But, some are skeptical about the long-term viability of these catalysts. How do you see us addressing those concerns?

Speaker 2: That's a fair point. The key is in the data. Recent studies have consistently shown that these catalysts maintain their efficiency without degradation over extended periods. That's something we should emphasize when presenting to stakeholders.

Speaker 1: True. But, we also need to acknowledge the initial costs and the need for further commercialization. It's about balancing optimism with realism to gain trust.

Speaker 2: Certainly, but let's not forget the potential for cost reductions as technology scales. The long-term savings in operational energy costs can outweigh the initial investment. It's an argument that aligns well with the policy's goals.

Speaker 1: Agreed. We need to highlight both the immediate benefits and the future potential. It's about creating a narrative that resonates with both policymakers and the public.

Speaker 2: Exactly. By presenting a unified front on the data and potential, we can achieve alignment with the audience. It’s not just about selling a technology; it's about fostering a shared vision for a sustainable future.

Speaker 1: And with the mandate as a driving force, it's the perfect opportunity to push forward. Let's gather our data and refine our approach. We need to ensure we're all speaking the same language when it comes to these advancements.

Speaker 2: Absolutely, let's get to it. Together, we can make a compelling case that aligns with the policy and public interest.

Speaker 1: Sounds good. Let’s make sure everyone sees the long-term benefits and the reality of these advancements.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Let's make it happen.
