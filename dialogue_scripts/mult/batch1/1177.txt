Dr. Thompson: Alright, everyone, let's refocus. We have an intriguing opportunity on our hands. The recent studies suggest that the PRDM1 gene, when combined with the PRDM14 gene, plays an important role during primordial germ cell specification. 

Dr. Evans: Intriguing, indeed, but let's not get ahead of ourselves, Dr. Thompson. We've seen hypotheses like this before.

Dr. Thompson: True, Dr. Evans. But the data from the latest experiments are compelling. This could redefine our approach to treating certain infertility issues.

Dr. Evans: Compelling or not, we've seen promising data before that didn't pan out. How do we know this isn't just another scientific mirage?

Dr. Thompson: Fair question. The difference here lies in the robustness of the genetic interactions. The PRDM1 and PRDM14 genes together have shown consistent results across multiple trials. It's not just a one-off observation.

Dr. Evans: Consistency is key, I agree. But we must also consider the complexity of germ cell development. One positive sign doesn't guarantee a breakthrough.

Dr. Thompson: Precisely why we need to explore this further. With strategic investment, we could be at the forefront of a significant advancement in reproductive medicine.

Dr. Evans: Strategic investment sounds great, but are we prepared for the potential pitfalls? We need to be sure that we're not chasing a hypothesis without solid groundwork.

Dr. Thompson: Absolutely, Dr. Evans. The groundwork is precisely why this is exciting. If we empower our research team now, we could pioneer a new therapeutic avenue. 

Dr. Evans: I see your point. But before committing, I want to see a detailed plan addressing potential obstacles. We need to ensure that any decision empowers us with both knowledge and foresight.

Dr. Thompson: Agreed. Let’s put together a comprehensive strategy. If we proceed wisely, this could be a pivotal moment for our research.

Dr. Evans: Let's make sure it’s a well-informed leap, not a blind dive. I'll await the detailed proposal. 

Dr. Thompson: Excellent. Let's move forward with caution, yet optimism.
