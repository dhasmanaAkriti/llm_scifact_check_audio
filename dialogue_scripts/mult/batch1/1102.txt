Dr. Caldwell: Good morning, Dr. Lin. Thanks for meeting with me on such short notice.

Dr. Lin: Of course, Dr. Caldwell. I assume this is about the new policy from the Department of Health regarding stem cell research?

Dr. Caldwell: Yes, exactly. The mandate requires us to reassess our substrates, specifically concerning their stiffness, in our mesodermal differentiation protocols. They've cited recent findings suggesting that stiff substrates inhibit differentiation by degrading beta-catenin in an integrin-dependent manner.

Dr. Lin: Ah, yes. I recall reading about that. Quite a significant claim. But how do they expect us to adapt so quickly? Our current protocols are optimized for rigidity.

Dr. Caldwell: That's precisely the challenge. We need to decide whether to pivot towards softer substrates and potentially redesign our entire protocol or contest the mandate, arguing that the evidence isn't conclusive enough.

Dr. Lin: Contesting it could be risky. If the findings hold, we might end up lagging behind in compliance and innovation.

Dr. Caldwell: True, but switching substrates without thorough testing could compromise our current projects. We need to ensure any new approach is viable.

Dr. Lin: Perhaps a phased approach? We could start a pilot study using softer substrates while maintaining our current methods for ongoing projects. This way, we gather data without a full-scale overhaul.

Dr. Caldwell: That could work. We can present the pilot results to the Department. It shows we're proactive yet cautious. 

Dr. Lin: Exactly. And who knows, we might discover benefits we hadn't anticipated. Science often surprises us.

Dr. Caldwell: Agreed. Let's draft a proposal for the pilot study, focusing on key differentiation markers and beta-catenin levels. We'll need approval, but it’s a sound plan.

Dr. Lin: I'll start gathering the team. Let's turn this mandate into an opportunity.

Dr. Caldwell: Perfect. Thank you, Dr. Lin. Let's make this work for us.
