Practitioner: Dr. Martinez, this recent study suggests that even oat-tolerant coeliac patients might have oat-specific inflammatory cells in their small bowel mucosa. It's quite unexpected.

Decision-Maker: That's certainly intriguing, Dr. Lin. We've long assumed oats were safe for these individuals. How robust is the data?

Practitioner: The data is quite compelling. The study employed advanced immunohistochemistry techniques, revealing these inflammatory cells in nearly 70% of participants who consumed oats.

Decision-Maker: So, you're saying there's a tangible immune response even in those who don't exhibit symptoms?

Practitioner: Precisely. This could shift our entire approach to dietary recommendations for coeliac patients. We might need to reconsider advising oats as universally safe.

Decision-Maker: But we must weigh the implications. Oats are a valuable dietary component. Removing them could result in nutritional deficiencies or reduced dietary variety.

Practitioner: True, but we can't ignore the potential inflammation and long-term consequences. We should conduct further studies to confirm these findings and possibly reassess our guidelines.

Decision-Maker: Agreed, further investigation is prudent. However, in the interim, should we inform patients about these findings?

Practitioner: I recommend a cautious approach. Perhaps informing them of the possibility and advising those with unexplained symptoms to temporarily exclude oats.

Decision-Maker: And should we communicate this to other healthcare providers?

Practitioner: Yes, but with the caveat that this is emerging research. We don't want to cause unnecessary alarm, but awareness is crucial.

Decision-Maker: Understood. Let's draft a statement highlighting the findings and recommend further evaluation for symptomatic patients. We should also prioritize funding for a comprehensive follow-up study.

Practitioner: I'll begin coordinating with the research team immediately. Thank you for your support.

Decision-Maker: Thank you, Dr. Lin. It's vital we approach this with both scientific rigor and patient welfare in mind.
