**Originator (Dr. Lewis):** Good afternoon, everyone. Following the recent policy shift on prescribing guidelines for postmenopausal women, I'd like to address a common concern: the mortality risk associated with antidepressant side effects.

**Interpreter (Dr. Kim):** Good afternoon, Dr. Lewis. I understand there's a new assertion that these side effects don't pose a mortality risk. Could you elaborate on that?

**Dr. Lewis:** Certainly. The updated guidelines suggest that while side effects are present, they don't statistically increase the mortality risk in postmenopausal women. This is based on longitudinal studies involving large sample sizes.

**Dr. Kim:** I see. However, isn't there still disagreement in the community about the long-term impacts, particularly regarding cardiovascular health?

**Dr. Lewis:** True, some studies do indicate varying results, but the consensus, influenced by recent data, leans towards minimal mortality risk. The new guidelines reflect this understanding, aiming to alleviate unnecessary fears.

**Dr. Kim:** But what about the psychological impact of these side effects? Even if they don’t directly lead to mortality, could they not contribute to a decline in overall health?

**Dr. Lewis:** That's a valid concern. The guidelines do suggest monitoring psychological well-being, but they emphasize that with proper management, the benefits outweigh the risks.

**Dr. Kim:** Yet, some practitioners argue that the side effects, like weight gain and sleep disturbances, shouldn't be downplayed. Could this not indirectly affect mortality through other health complications?

**Dr. Lewis:** It's a complex issue, Dr. Kim. The guidelines recommend a personalized approach, considering individual health profiles. The goal is to ensure that the treatment plan is holistic and comprehensive.

**Dr. Kim:** I appreciate the clarification. It seems the disagreement lies not in the data itself, but in how we interpret and apply it to individual cases.

**Dr. Lewis:** Precisely. The dialogue must continue, and feedback from practitioners like you is crucial to refining these guidelines further.

**Dr. Kim:** Thank you, Dr. Lewis. I look forward to continued discussions as we navigate these new recommendations together.
