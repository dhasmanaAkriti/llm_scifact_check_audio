Practitioner: Let's address the elephant in the room. The tonic signaling from the scFv prevents constitutive stimulation. It's crucial for patient safety.

Decision-Maker: I understand, but implementing this change carries significant financial risk. We need more than just a theoretical assurance.

Practitioner: The data's robust. Ignoring it could lead to overstimulation and potentially catastrophic outcomes. We can't afford to overlook this.

Decision-Maker: But you're asking for a complete overhaul of our current protocol. That’s no small feat. What if the scFv doesn't perform as expected?

Practitioner: The risk of not acting is far greater. We have peer-reviewed studies backing this up. We need to mitigate the possibility of overstimulation now.

Decision-Maker: Can you guarantee this change will yield the expected results? Our stakeholders need certainty.

Practitioner: In science, guarantees are rare. But the evidence strongly suggests this is the right course. It’s about risk management, not just cost-cutting.

Decision-Maker: And what about the timeline? Our current commitments don't accommodate this kind of disruption.

Practitioner: The longer we delay, the greater the threat to patient safety. We must act swiftly.

Decision-Maker: I hear your concerns, but I need a comprehensive plan with clear deliverables. Can you provide that?

Practitioner: Absolutely. I'll compile a detailed proposal outlining the steps, expected outcomes, and a timeline for implementation.

Decision-Maker: All right, let's see that proposal. But remember, the board will scrutinize every detail.

Practitioner: Understood. Patient safety remains our priority, and this change is essential to uphold it.

Decision-Maker: I appreciate your passion. Let's reconvene once I've reviewed your plan.

Practitioner: Thank you. I’m confident you’ll see the necessity once you have all the information.

Decision-Maker: Very well. We'll touch base soon.
