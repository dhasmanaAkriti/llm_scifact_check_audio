**Advocate (Dr. Okoro):** Good afternoon, Dr. Lane. I heard you had some questions about the recent report on Nigerian physicians in the U.S.?

**Skeptic (Dr. Lane):** Yes, I did, Dr. Okoro. The claim that Nigerian physicians are the largest component of sub-Saharan Africa-trained physicians in the U.S. seems a bit exaggerated to me. Could you clarify that?

**Dr. Okoro:** Absolutely. The data from the Association of American Medical Colleges actually supports this. Nigerian-trained doctors make up a significant portion of the sub-Saharan African medical workforce here.

**Dr. Lane:** But isn’t that because of a lack of opportunities back home? I mean, how does that impact our healthcare system?

**Dr. Okoro:** That’s a common misconception. While some do seek better opportunities, many Nigerian physicians come here for advanced training and contribute significantly to underserved areas. They fill critical gaps in primary care and specialties.

**Dr. Lane:** I see. But how is this beneficial for both countries?

**Dr. Okoro:** It’s a symbiotic relationship. The U.S. benefits from their expertise, and many physicians return to Nigeria with advanced skills, improving healthcare there. Plus, there's a strong diaspora network that supports health initiatives back home.

**Dr. Lane:** Interesting. So, you’re saying this isn’t just a one-way street?

**Dr. Okoro:** Exactly. It’s important to see the broader picture. These physicians not only support the U.S. healthcare system but also foster international medical collaborations. 

**Dr. Lane:** That makes sense. Thank you for explaining. It seems I had a rather narrow view of the situation.

**Dr. Okoro:** No problem at all. I’m glad to shed some light on this. It’s crucial we understand the global context of our medical workforce.

**Dr. Lane:** Indeed. I appreciate your insights, Dr. Okoro. This definitely empowers me to look at this data from a more informed perspective.

**Dr. Okoro:** Anytime, Dr. Lane. Always here to help bridge any gaps in understanding.
