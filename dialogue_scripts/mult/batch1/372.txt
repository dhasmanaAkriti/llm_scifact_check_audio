Speaker 1: So, Sarah, you've heard about the Eilat virus, right? There's a study showing it produces rapid and long-lasting antibodies in nonhuman primates. This could be groundbreaking for vaccine development.

Speaker 2: I have, John. But don't you think it's a bit early to start celebrating? We're talking about a virus developed in mosquitoes. That doesn't exactly scream "safe and effective" to me.

Speaker 1: I get the skepticism, but think about the potential. If it works in primates, it could revolutionize our approach to viral diseases.

Speaker 2: But isn't that a huge leap? From primates to humans? And what about the risks of using a virus from mosquitoes? They’re vectors for so many diseases.

Speaker 1: True, there's always a risk. But the antibodies produced were both rapid and long-lasting. That's a significant advantage over current vaccines.

Speaker 2: But what if we don't fully understand the long-term effects? The threat isn't just the virus itself, it's the unknowns. Are we ready to gamble on that?

Speaker 1: It's not about gambling. It's about exploring every avenue. If we don't take calculated risks, we could miss out on a major scientific breakthrough.

Speaker 2: Calculated risks are one thing, but isn't this moving too fast? The consequences of rushing could be disastrous.

Speaker 1: I agree we need to be cautious, but we can't ignore promising data. It's about finding a balance between innovation and safety.

Speaker 2: I just think we need more transparency and rigorous testing before taking this any further. The stakes are high, John.

Speaker 1: Definitely. Let's focus on defining the parameters for safe trials. We can continue debating, but let's ensure we're prepared for both the risks and the rewards.

Speaker 2: Agreed. Let's map out what can be done to address these concerns responsibly.
