Speaker 1: So, the claim is that sequence conservation in gene regulatory regions between species is a poor predictor of conserved functionality. That's quite a departure from what we've been taught, isn't it?

Speaker 2: It is. And I think the key point of confusion here lies in the assumption that conservation always equates to functionality. But look at the studies showing that some highly conserved sequences don't actually have a clear functional role.

Speaker 1: But doesn't conservation suggest evolutionary pressure to maintain a sequence due to its importance?

Speaker 2: Not necessarily. There are elements that are conserved due to other factors, like neutral evolution or genetic drift. The mere presence of conservation doesn't automatically imply a specific function.

Speaker 1: But isn't it counterintuitive? We’ve always linked conservation with significance. If the sequence is maintained, it must mean something, right?

Speaker 2: That’s where the misunderstanding kicks in. What we need to define is what 'significant' means in this context. Significance in one species doesn't translate directly to another. Look at enhancers; they can be conserved yet have divergent functions across species.

Speaker 1: So, how do we strategically approach this? If conservation isn't a reliable predictor, what should we focus on?

Speaker 2: We need to refine our tools. Instead of just looking at sequence conservation, let’s incorporate functional assays and comparative genomics to assess actual regulatory roles.

Speaker 1: So, it's about broadening our criteria for functionality, not dismissing conservation outright, right?

Speaker 2: Exactly. It's about integrating multiple lines of evidence. Sequence data alone isn’t the full story. We need a more nuanced view.

Speaker 1: Alright, I see the disagreement now. It's not about throwing out conservation, but about understanding its limitations. We need a broader lens.

Speaker 2: Precisely. Let's redefine what we consider evidence of function. It's not just about the sequence; it's about context and interaction.

Speaker 1: Agreed. Time to rethink our approach to comparative genomics.

Speaker 2: Definitely. Let's map this out further in our next meeting.
