Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, we'll be discussing the structural components of the PRR MDA5, specifically the claim about its C-terminal domain. 

Dr. Lee: Ah, yes, the C-terminal domain. There's been some confusion on whether it actually exists in MDA5.

Dr. Collins: Indeed, Dr. Lee. I understand there's some skepticism, but the recent studies indicate that the C-terminal domain is a crucial part of MDA5's functionality.

Dr. Lee: Right, but if I may, the data from our lab hasn't shown any definitive evidence of this domain. Our models suggest the structure might be different.

Dr. Collins: That’s interesting. Could it be a methodological discrepancy? The papers I've reviewed were quite thorough in their structural analyses.

Dr. Lee: It's possible. However, our team used cryo-EM, which provided a detailed view, yet we didn't see a C-terminal domain. Have there been any peer reviews challenging this?

Dr. Collins: Not directly, but there's a growing body of work supporting its presence. If this domain plays a role in viral RNA recognition, it would be a significant oversight.

Dr. Lee: Agreed, but we need to ensure our conclusions are based on replicable data. Would you be open to a collaborative study to resolve this?

Dr. Collins: Absolutely. A joint effort might bring clarity. It’s crucial we align on this before making strategic decisions about further research directions.

Dr. Lee: I concur. Let’s map out the points of conflict and see where our data diverges. Perhaps a joint publication could also address this disparity.

Dr. Collins: Good idea. Let's define our disagreement clearly, and we can set up a timeline for this collaboration. The goal is to ensure our findings are robust and reliable.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. I'll coordinate with my team to prepare our data for review. Thank you, Dr. Collins, for addressing this directly. 

Dr. Collins: Thank you, Dr. Lee. Together, we’ll ensure the scientific community receives accurate information.
