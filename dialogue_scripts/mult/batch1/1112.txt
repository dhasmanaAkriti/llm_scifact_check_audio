Dr. Patel: So, Dr. Reynolds, have you heard about the new health mandate requiring us to reassess patients with orthostatic hypertension? 

Dr. Reynolds: Yes, I did. It's quite a shake-up. They say sudden death can occur even without cardiac conduction abnormalities. Seems quite the claim.

Dr. Patel: Indeed. I'm skeptical. We've always associated sudden deaths with clear cardiac issues. This idea feels... premature.

Dr. Reynolds: Yet, the data they referenced is compelling. A Swedish cohort study, if I recall correctly. But are we really ready to overhaul our protocols based on one study?

Dr. Patel: Exactly my concern. We need a broader evidence base before making such drastic changes. Over-diagnosing could lead to unnecessary anxiety for patients.

Dr. Reynolds: True, but ignoring potential risks isn't ideal either. The mandate is pushing us to be proactive, perhaps even a bit cautious.

Dr. Patel: Cautious is one thing, but we mustn't act on assumptions. Sudden death is a serious claim. It demands rigorous scrutiny, not knee-jerk reactions.

Dr. Reynolds: Agreed. But consider this: if the mandate saves even a handful of lives, wouldn't it be worth the effort?

Dr. Patel: Possibly. Yet, it feels like we're trying to solve an unsolved puzzle with only half the pieces.

Dr. Reynolds: Then perhaps the truth lies in striking a balance. We could advocate for further research while cautiously implementing some preventive measures.

Dr. Patel: That sounds reasonable. Let's propose a review of current patient data in our next meeting. See if we can find any patterns ourselves.

Dr. Reynolds: A proactive approach, indeed. And if our findings align or contradict, we'll have a stronger case to present.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. We owe it to our patients to validate or refute such claims with integrity. 

Dr. Reynolds: Then it's settled. Let's get to work.
