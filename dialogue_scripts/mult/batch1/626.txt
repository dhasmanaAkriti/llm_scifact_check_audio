Dr. Collins: Good afternoon, Dr. Ramirez. I understand there's been a significant development in your research on podocytes.

Dr. Ramirez: Indeed, Dr. Collins. Our latest findings suggest that induction of urokinase receptor signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and subsequent proteinuria.

Dr. Collins: Fascinating. But, correct me if I'm wrong, hasn't the prevailing understanding been that podocyte injury primarily results from structural protein mutations?

Dr. Ramirez: Yes, that's been the conventional wisdom. However, our data points to a signaling pathway disruption as a pivotal factor.

Dr. Collins: I'm intrigued, but also skeptical. What evidence supports this signaling hypothesis over the established structural view?

Dr. Ramirez: We observed that manipulating the urokinase receptor in cultured podocytes directly resulted in morphological changes and protein leakage, which mirrors the phenotype of proteinuria in patients.

Dr. Collins: While the in vitro data is compelling, does it translate to clinical observations? Have you seen similar patterns in patient biopsies?

Dr. Ramirez: We have limited biopsy data, but the patterns are consistent with our laboratory findings. However, I admit more comprehensive clinical studies are needed.

Dr. Collins: That's a crucial step. Until then, the hypothesis remains unsubstantiated within the broader context of kidney disease pathology.

Dr. Ramirez: I appreciate the caution. Nevertheless, this could redefine our approach to treating proteinuria if further validated.

Dr. Collins: It might. But without large-scale validation, proposing a shift in treatment paradigms seems premature.

Dr. Ramirez: True. Our goal is to open a dialogue and encourage further investigation. I believe this could lead to more targeted therapies.

Dr. Collins: A worthy pursuit, Dr. Ramirez. Let's continue this conversation as more data becomes available. Collaboration may guide us to a consensus.

Dr. Ramirez: Agreed. I'm hopeful that together, we'll advance our understanding and improve patient outcomes.
