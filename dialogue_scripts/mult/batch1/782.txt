Practitioner: So, Dr. Fields, we've encountered a significant issue in the lab. Our recent experiment suggests that mice lacking IFN-γ or its receptor are highly susceptible to EAM when induced with α-MyHC/CFA. 

Decision-Maker: Sorry, could you clarify that for me, Dr. Patel? I'm a bit confused by the findings.

Practitioner: Of course. We expected these mice to show some resistance, given their altered immune response. However, the data indicates they are actually more vulnerable to the disease. 

Decision-Maker: Right, but doesn't IFN-γ usually play a role in promoting inflammation? How does its absence increase susceptibility?

Practitioner: That's precisely the perplexing part. Normally, IFN-γ is crucial for immune regulation, but its absence might be disrupting a balance we didn’t anticipate, perhaps making the immune system overly permissive to the induction of EAM.

Decision-Maker: I see. So, what does this mean for our current research path?

Practitioner: Well, it suggests we need to reassess our understanding of IFN-γ's role. We might need to pivot and explore alternative immune pathways. This could impact our therapeutic development strategies.

Decision-Maker: That's quite a shift. How soon could we adjust our focus, and what resources would we need?

Practitioner: We can start with a detailed review of existing literature and possibly initiate a few exploratory tests to verify our hypothesis. Additional funding for these tests would be beneficial, but the reallocation of some current resources might suffice for initial stages.

Decision-Maker: Alright, Dr. Patel, let's set up a meeting with the team to discuss these changes. I want us to be sure we're making informed decisions moving forward.

Practitioner: Absolutely, Dr. Fields. I'll prepare a comprehensive report and gather the team for a strategy session. This is a crucial juncture, and I believe with the right approach, we can uncover valuable insights.

Decision-Maker: Thank you. Let’s ensure we’re on the cutting edge of this field. Your expertise is invaluable here.

Practitioner: Thank you, Dr. Fields. I’m optimistic about the possibilities.
