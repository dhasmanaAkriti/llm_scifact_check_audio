**Dr. Patel (Advocate):** We've just received data from the latest trials, and it seems persistor cells are a significant factor in why some cancer patients don't fully respond to TKI therapy.

**Dr. Carter (Skeptic):** Persistor cells? I've read about them, but aren't they just theoretical at this point? We should be cautious about jumping to conclusions based on preliminary data.

**Dr. Patel:** I understand your hesitation, but the evidence is compelling. These cells go into a dormant state, surviving the TKI treatment, and can lead to relapse. Ignoring them could mean missing a crucial piece of the puzzle.

**Dr. Carter:** But how can we be sure this isn't just a temporary anomaly? We need more than initial findings before reshaping our treatment protocols.

**Dr. Patel:** The consistency across multiple patient samples suggests otherwise. If we target these persistor cells, we might improve TKI efficacy. It’s an opportunity to enhance patient outcomes.

**Dr. Carter:** Still, altering treatment strategies based on this could be premature. We risk diverting resources from proven methods to chase something uncertain.

**Dr. Patel:** But that's the nature of scientific advancement, isn’t it? We must adapt as new data emerges. Consider the potential benefits of addressing this now rather than later.

**Dr. Carter:** I agree we should stay informed, but shouldn't we wait for more corroborative studies before overhauling our approach?

**Dr. Patel:** What if we initiate a targeted pilot study? It’s a balanced way to test the hypothesis without fully committing resources. We can gather more data and make informed decisions.

**Dr. Carter:** A pilot study does sound reasonable. It allows us to explore this without jeopardizing current treatment regimens. I suppose it’s worth considering.

**Dr. Patel:** Great, I’ll draft a proposal for our next meeting. Let's ensure we’re at the forefront of this potential breakthrough.

**Dr. Carter:** Agreed. We owe it to our patients to explore all avenues.
