**Advocate (Dr. Lee):** Good morning, Dr. Patel. Have you seen the recent study on nuclear transfer from adult human fibroblasts to human oocytes?

**Skeptic (Dr. Patel):** Yes, I have. It claims to produce blastocysts with expandable pluripotent cells. Quite a bold assertion, wouldn't you say?

**Dr. Lee:** Bold, indeed, but not without merit. The potential for regenerative medicine is immense. Imagine the possibilities for personalized therapies.

**Dr. Patel:** I understand the enthusiasm, but let's not get ahead of ourselves. This is a single study. Replication is key, and we need more evidence before making any strategic choices.

**Dr. Lee:** Of course, replication is crucial. However, the methodology was robust. They used adult human fibroblasts, which are more accessible and ethically favorable compared to embryonic sources.

**Dr. Patel:** True, but fibroblasts have their own set of challenges. The reprogramming efficiency and the stability of induced pluripotent cells still raise questions.

**Dr. Lee:** That's precisely why this discovery is significant. It offers a new approach, potentially overcoming those hurdles. Shouldn't we consider allocating resources to explore this further?

**Dr. Patel:** Resources are limited. We must be judicious. What about the risks? The genomic integrity of these cells might be compromised during nuclear transfer.

**Dr. Lee:** A valid concern, but the study showed promising results with minimal genetic abnormalities. It's a step in the right direction.

**Dr. Patel:** Promising but not definitive. We need a thorough risk assessment before proceeding. We can't ignore the ethical implications if something goes awry.

**Dr. Lee:** And we won’t. But if we don't act, we might miss out on groundbreaking advancements. We should at least form a committee to evaluate the potential.

**Dr. Patel:** I agree, a committee could help map out the disagreement and weigh the benefits against the risks. Let's ensure we approach this with caution and clarity.

**Dr. Lee:** Absolutely, caution and clarity are our guiding principles. Let's schedule a meeting to discuss this further with the board.
