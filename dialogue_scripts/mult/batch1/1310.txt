Speaker 1: Alright, Emma, this new study's throwing everything we thought we knew into chaos. Traditional reviews might be biased.

Speaker 2: Yeah, I read through it. They're claiming those reviews are skewed because of subjective interpretations. I mean, it makes sense. We all have our biases.

Speaker 1: Exactly. And if the data's right, it means our entire approach to peer reviews could be flawed. That's huge.

Speaker 2: It is. But what do we do with this information? If we accept it, we might need to overhaul our review process.

Speaker 1: Or at least start rethinking how we evaluate these reviews. Maybe introduce some new guidelines or checks for bias detection.

Speaker 2: I agree, but implementing changes like that won't be easy. There's so much at stake here – reputations, established methodologies.

Speaker 1: True, but isn't it better to adapt than to cling to a broken system? We owe it to the scientific community to be transparent.

Speaker 2: Of course. But how do we approach this without causing a rift? We need to be strategic.

Speaker 1: What if we propose a pilot study? Test the new guidelines on a smaller scale before rolling them out universally?

Speaker 2: That could work. We can gather data on its efficacy and present it to the board. But who leads this initiative? It's going to be a lot of work.

Speaker 1: I think we should spearhead it together. We've got the experience and the drive. Plus, we've already started this conversation.

Speaker 2: You're right. It's a big step, but I’m in. Let's draft a proposal and see where it takes us.

Speaker 1: Great. Let’s meet tomorrow and start outlining our plan. We need to be thorough.

Speaker 2: Agreed. This could be a turning point for us and for how future research is conducted.
