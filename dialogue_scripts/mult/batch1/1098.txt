Dr. Evans: So, Dr. Lee, have you reviewed the new data on nucleotide stacking stability?

Dr. Lee: I have, and to be honest, I'm skeptical. You're claiming that a purine at the +5 position enhances stability, specifically at C1698?

Dr. Evans: Indeed. Our recent findings suggest that the purine's larger structure offers greater stacking interactions, thus stabilizing the entire helical structure.

Dr. Lee: But isn't it somewhat presumptive to attribute stability solely to the presence of a purine? What about the surrounding sequence context or environmental conditions?

Dr. Evans: Those factors certainly play a role, but our controlled experiments isolated the variable to C1698. The results were consistent across different conditions.

Dr. Lee: Consistent in your lab, perhaps. But have you considered natural variations? In vivo environments can differ drastically.

Dr. Evans: We did account for that. We collaborated with a team conducting in vivo studies. Their preliminary data aligns with our in vitro results.

Dr. Lee: Aligns, or shows a similar trend? There's a difference. I need more than just coinciding trends to be convinced of such a broad claim.

Dr. Evans: The statistical significance was robust, Dr. Lee. I can show you the p-values, which were well below the threshold.

Dr. Lee: Statistics aside, I'm concerned about the reproducibility of these findings. Other labs need to confirm this before we consider it a truth.

Dr. Evans: That's precisely why we're presenting this now. We're openly inviting others to replicate our study. Science thrives on rigorous testing and validation.

Dr. Lee: I'll admit, your openness is reassuring. I'll review the data more thoroughly and perhaps suggest it to colleagues for further testing.

Dr. Evans: I welcome that, Dr. Lee. We all aim for the same end: the pursuit of truth. If there's a flaw, we'll find it together.

Dr. Lee: Agreed. Let's keep the dialogue open. After all, science is a collective endeavor.
