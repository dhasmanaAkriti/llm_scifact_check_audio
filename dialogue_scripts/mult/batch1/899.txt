Practitioner: So, Dr. Jensen, the recent findings from our lab have quite the implications. Oxidative DNA damage seems to inhibit STING signaling, which was previously unexpected.

Decision-Maker: That’s a significant claim, Dr. Lee. But how robust is this data? Our strategic direction hinges on STING pathway activation for our upcoming therapeutics.

Practitioner: Absolutely, and that’s precisely why this discovery is urgent. We replicated the results across multiple assays and conditions. The evidence is consistent.

Decision-Maker: I’m aware, but we’ve invested heavily in the premise that enhancing STING signaling will bolster immune response. Are we suggesting a pivot?

Practitioner: Not necessarily a pivot, but a reevaluation. If oxidative damage impairs STING, our current approach could be compromised. We need to consider alternative pathways or adjunctive strategies.

Decision-Maker: But won’t that delay our timelines? We’re under pressure to deliver on our current pipeline.

Practitioner: It might adjust our timeline, yes, but better now than post-launch. We risk ineffective treatments otherwise. The data suggests we need to adapt.

Decision-Maker: Adapt how, exactly? Are there specific modifications to the current compounds?

Practitioner: Potentially. We could look into co-treatments that mitigate oxidative damage or explore compounds that bypass the STING pathway. 

Decision-Maker: That’s a significant shift, Dr. Lee. Have you identified potential candidates?

Practitioner: We have a shortlist, but it’s preliminary. I propose a task force to accelerate this evaluation.

Decision-Maker: Hmm. This isn’t what we planned for. But I see your point. We'll need to present this to the board. Prepare a detailed report by next week. 

Practitioner: Understood. It's a complex situation, but addressing it now ensures we stay at the forefront.

Decision-Maker: Very well. Let’s ensure our findings are watertight. The stakes are high.

Practitioner: Absolutely. We’re on it.
