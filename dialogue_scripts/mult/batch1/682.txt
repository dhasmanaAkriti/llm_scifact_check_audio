**Dr. Lane (Originator):** Ladies and gentlemen, today I present a groundbreaking discovery: the absence of FGF21 in mice substantially reduces their lifespan. 

**Dr. Patel (Interpreter):** Dr. Lane, that's quite a statement. Could you clarify how you arrived at that conclusion?

**Dr. Lane:** Certainly, Dr. Patel. Our lab conducted a study where we knocked out the FGF21 gene in a group of mice. Over the course of their lives, these mice exhibited a significantly shorter lifespan compared to the control group.

**Dr. Patel:** Fascinating. However, I'm curious—did you account for environmental factors that might have influenced their lifespan?

**Dr. Lane:** Indeed, we maintained a controlled environment for both the experimental and control groups to ensure that our findings were attributable solely to the absence of FGF21.

**Dr. Patel:** But isn't it possible that the gene knockout could have triggered compensatory mechanisms in the mice, affecting other metabolic pathways?

**Dr. Lane:** That's a valid point. We monitored various metabolic markers and found no significant compensatory changes that could account for the lifespan discrepancy.

**Dr. Patel:** Interesting. Yet, some studies suggest that FGF21 might have a role in stress response. Could the lack of this protein have made the mice more susceptible to stress, indirectly affecting their lifespan?

**Dr. Lane:** While stress response is indeed a potential factor, our data showed no increased stress markers. However, this is an area we intend to explore further.

**Dr. Patel:** I appreciate your thorough approach, Dr. Lane. Still, I wonder if the model used truly reflects the complexity of life systems. Mice are not humans, after all.

**Dr. Lane:** Agreed, Dr. Patel. Our study is a stepping stone, and further research in more complex organisms is essential. But this finding opens up new avenues in the study of aging and metabolism.

**Dr. Patel:** Thank you for your insights, Dr. Lane. It seems there's much more to uncover about FGF21's role in lifespan.

**Dr. Lane:** Thank you, Dr. Patel. The pursuit of science is ever-evolving, and I hope
