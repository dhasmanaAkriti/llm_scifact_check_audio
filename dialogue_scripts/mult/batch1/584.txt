Practitioner: Good afternoon, everyone. Today, I want to discuss a groundbreaking discovery regarding simian-human immunodeficiency virus, or SHIV, in rhesus macaques.

Decision-Maker: Afternoon. We're all ears. What's the discovery?

Practitioner: Recent studies have shown that daily subcutaneous injections of tenofovir can effectively protect against rectally transmitted SHIV in these primates.

Decision-Maker: Tenofovir, the same drug used in HIV PrEP for humans?

Practitioner: Precisely. The implications here are significant. If we can establish similar efficacy in humans, it could revolutionize prevention strategies.

Decision-Maker: Interesting. But aren't there already established methods for SHIV prevention in research settings?

Practitioner: There are, but none with this level of potential efficacy and ease of administration. It’s a paradigm shift, really.

Decision-Maker: How conclusive is the data? We're talking about a leap from primates to humans, a notoriously tricky transition.

Practitioner: The data is robust. The sample size was substantial, and the results were consistent across varying conditions. But, yes, you're right. Translating this to human trials will require careful planning.

Decision-Maker: What about the risks? Are there any adverse effects documented in the macaques?

Practitioner: Minimal. The side effects were negligible and comparable to those observed in human use of tenofovir. 

Decision-Maker: That's reassuring. So, what's the next step? Are you proposing we initiate human trials?

Practitioner: Yes, I recommend we start with a small, controlled trial to assess safety and tolerability in humans.

Decision-Maker: And the timeframe? How soon can we mobilize resources for this trial?

Practitioner: With your approval, we could begin preparations immediately. I estimate the trial could commence within six months.

Decision-Maker: Given the potential impact, I’m inclined to support this. Let's proceed with the necessary approvals and prepare to make this a priority.

Practitioner: Thank you. I believe this could be a pivotal advancement in our fight against HIV.

Decision-Maker: Agreed. Let's make it happen.
