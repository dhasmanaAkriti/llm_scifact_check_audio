 Scientific claim: Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is not predictive of acute respiratory failure after solid organ transplantation. 
 Participant Dynamics: Practitioner vs. Decision-Maker 
 Contextual Arena: The Personal Arena (goal: to resolve a personal, high-stakes matter) 
 Interaction Trigger: An External Mandate (a new law, policy, or trend) 
 Dialogue Objective: To Define the Disagreement (map out points of conflict) 
```plaintext
**Dr. Kim:** So, the new policy from the health board states that we should be cautious about using noninvasive positive pressure ventilation post-transplant, suggesting it doesn't predict acute respiratory failure.

**Dr. Patel:** Yes, I read the mandate. But where does that leave us with our current patient protocols?

**Dr. Kim:** That's the issue. It's a bit of a conundrum. We've relied on these methods for years. The policy questions their predictive value, but not their efficacy.

**Dr. Patel:** Exactly. The policy implies a shift in our evaluation process, but doesn't propose an alternative. Isn't that a bit premature?

**Dr. Kim:** It does seem that way. The evidence isn't conclusive enough to overhaul our current practices, especially when we're dealing with high-stakes cases like organ transplants.

**Dr. Patel:** And yet, the board is pushing for adherence. How do we bridge this gap between policy and practice?

**Dr. Kim:** We need to define our disagreement with the policy first. Is it the interpretation of the data or the lack of practical alternatives that's bothering us?

**Dr. Patel:** I believe it's both. The data doesn't definitively support the claim, and abandoning a tool without a viable substitute is reckless for our patients.

**Dr. Kim:** Agreed. Our focus should be on patient outcomes. Perhaps we could propose a pilot study to the board, assessing both the current and alternative methods in parallel.

**Dr. Patel:** That sounds like a plan. We need to present a united front on this. Ensuring the board understands the nuances and stakes involved is crucial.

**Dr. Kim:** I'll draft a proposal. Let's meet with the team to gather insights and solidify our stance.

**Dr. Patel:** Perfect. We need to ensure our voices are heard, for the sake of our patients' health and safety.
