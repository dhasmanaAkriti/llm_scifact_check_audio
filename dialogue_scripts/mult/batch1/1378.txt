Dr. Ellison: Today, we'll discuss an alarming trend in pneumonia-related fatalities. Recent studies indicate that women are more susceptible to death from pneumonia compared to men. 

Dr. Patel: That's quite a claim, Dr. Ellison. What data supports this?

Dr. Ellison: The studies show that women have a higher incidence of severe respiratory complications, possibly due to differences in immune response and hormonal factors.

Dr. Patel: Interesting. But does this mean we need to alter treatment protocols for women?

Dr. Ellison: Precisely. If women are at higher risk, then adapting our approach to prevention and treatment may be crucial.

Dr. Patel: What about the threat of overmedication? We must avoid unnecessary antibiotics, which could lead to resistance.

Dr. Ellison: True, Dr. Patel. It's a delicate balance. We must prioritize accurate diagnostics to ensure targeted treatment.

Dr. Patel: And how do we communicate this risk to our patients without causing unnecessary alarm?

Dr. Ellison: Education is key. We should inform them of the risks and symptoms, stressing the importance of early intervention.

Dr. Patel: So, should we propose a new protocol for our department?

Dr. Ellison: Yes, I believe it's essential. A tailored approach could save lives. We can draft a proposal for review.

Dr. Patel: Agreed. Let's do it. But we must back it with solid evidence to gain consensus.

Dr. Ellison: Certainly. I'll gather the necessary data and prepare a presentation. 

Dr. Patel: Excellent. Let's aim to present it at the next departmental meeting.

Dr. Ellison: Let's. It's crucial we address this threat before it escalates further.

Dr. Patel: Agreed, Dr. Ellison. Together, we can make a significant impact.

Dr. Ellison: Indeed, Dr. Patel. Let's get to work.
