Practitioner: So, the proposal suggests that immune complex triggered cell death leads to the sequestration of oxidized mitochondrial DNA. But, there's a bit of confusion on how exactly this sequestration process occurs. Could you elaborate on that?

Decision-Maker: Certainly. The main point of contention seems to be the mechanism by which the cell recognizes and isolates the oxidized mitochondrial DNA. The current hypothesis is that damaged mitochondria release signals that prompt this sequestration. Does that align with your understanding?

Practitioner: Yes, but isn't there a contradiction? If the immune complexes are mediating cell death, wouldn't the mitochondrial DNA be degraded before sequestration could occur?

Decision-Maker: It's a valid concern. However, the research indicates that the sequestration might happen rapidly post cell death initiation, before significant degradation. It's like a swift cleanup operation. Could that be feasible in your experimental setup?

Practitioner: It's possible, though the timing would need to be exceptionally precise. We might need to employ real-time imaging to capture the sequence of events. Should we proceed with that approach?

Decision-Maker: I think that's a prudent step. But, should we also consider alternative pathways that might explain the sequestration, in case this hypothesis doesn't hold up?

Practitioner: Definitely. Parallel pathways could include direct signaling from the immune complexes to the mitochondrial DNA itself. That could provide a clearer link. Should we allocate resources to explore both avenues?

Decision-Maker: Yes, let's do that. It’s essential to have a comprehensive understanding. We'll need to prepare a detailed proposal for additional funding. Is that something you can draft by next week?

Practitioner: Absolutely. I'll start compiling our current data and outline potential methodologies for both pathways. Anything else you'd like included?

Decision-Maker: No, that's a solid start. Let's regroup after you've drafted it. Thanks for clarifying the confusion. It's crucial we get this right.

Practitioner: Agreed. I'll keep you posted on any developments. Thank you for your guidance.
