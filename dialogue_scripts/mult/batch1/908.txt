Speaker 1: Alright, so we've got this new policy from the health department. They're pushing the claim that PGE 2 suppresses intestinal tumor growth by altering gene expression. What do you make of it?

Speaker 2: Well, you know I'm skeptical about these sweeping scientific endorsements. Science is rarely that straightforward.

Speaker 1: True, but the data seems solid. They've shown that PGE 2 can actually modify tumor suppressing and DNA repair genes.

Speaker 2: But the question is, how do we know it's not affecting other genes negatively? A single compound rarely acts in isolation.

Speaker 1: That's a fair point. However, the trials were quite comprehensive. They found no significant adverse effects during the study period.

Speaker 2: "During the study period"—that's a bit of a red flag, isn't it? Long-term effects could be lurking just beyond that timeframe.

Speaker 1: Sure, but that's why they're rolling it out gradually. The new policy encourages more research and monitoring as it's implemented.

Speaker 2: Encouraging, yes, but mandating it would be more reassuring. Plus, altering gene expression sounds like playing with fire. 

Speaker 1: That's why controls and ethical oversight are in place. This isn't some fringe science; it's backed by peer-reviewed research.

Speaker 2: Peer-reviewed doesn't mean foolproof. Remember the whole CRISPR controversy? We need to be cautious about genetic interventions.

Speaker 1: Caution is important, absolutely. But dismissing promising treatments could mean delaying potential life-saving therapies.

Speaker 2: Delaying isn't always bad if it means ensuring safety. We can't rush just because something looks promising on paper.

Speaker 1: Agreed. But we can't afford to stand still either. The potential benefits here are too significant to ignore entirely.

Speaker 2: That's why ongoing scrutiny is crucial. Let's just hope they don't let potential profits cloud their judgment.

Speaker 1: Fair enough. We both want the same outcome: treatments that are both effective and safe. Let's keep an eye on how this unfolds.
